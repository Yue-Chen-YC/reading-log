## Phonetic imitation from an individual-difference perspective: Subjective attitude, personality and “autistic” traits (Yu et al., 2013)

## Citation 
Yu, A. C., Abrego-Collier, C., & Sonderegger, M. (2013). Phonetic imitation from an individual-difference perspective: Subjective attitude, personality and “autistic” traits. PloS one, 8(9), e74746.

## My thoughts
- They found significance on ASQ and Big Five, but no significance for working memory as measured by RSPAN
- If working memory capacity is shown to have an effect on ignore irrelevant or interfering information and maintain focus on a specific goal, this seems to be an important factor for individual difference factors, but this paper did not found an significance on this
  - I should look for tasks on working memeory capacity.
  - working ememory capacity also affect sentence processing! (MacDonald MC, Christiansen MH (2002) Reassessing working memory: Comment on Just and Carpenter (1992) and Waters and Caplan (1996). Psychological Review 109: 35–54.)
  - Autistic traits can be measured by the ASQ or the empathy quotient
    - shown to signficiantly correlated with individual personlity traits and social network characteristics
    
## Summary 
Overall this paper offers further evidence that the extent of phonetic imitation is higher regulated by individual-level variables, such as individual's judgement of their interlocutor and the social and cognitive profile of the individual. Phonetic imitation: a process by which the production patterns of an individual become more similar on some phonetic or acoustic dimension to those of their interlocutor. This study looks at the phenomenon of phonetic imitation using a within-subject design embedded in an individual-differences framework (e.g., autism-spectrum, working memory, personality). Subjective perspectives on phonetic imitation, the participants assigned to one of the four experimental conditions: sexual orientation of the narrator, outcome of the story. They found that the extent of phonetic imitation by an individual is significantly modulated by the story outcome, by participant's subjeciyive attitude toward the model talker, and participant's personality trait of openness and the autistic-like trait associated with attention switching. 

## Research Questions 
1. How does VOT shift as a result of hearing the narrative across subjects after controlling for other factors
2. What factors affect how much a subject's VOT shifts?

##  Key Concepts
- phonetic imitation = convergence
- phonetic divergence = reverse process
- Communication Accommodtion Theory: speech convergence phenomena as motivated by an individual's desire for social acceptance and identification with a particular social group.

## Individual differences demionsions 
1. working memeory capacity (WMC): the ability to control attention and deal with irrelevant information, and not simply the amount of information that can reside in working memeory. = individual differences are not due to some limited amount of activation available to the working memory system but to an indicidual's ability to ignore irrelecant information (on the basis of a specific relevant goal) through the control of attention
  - individuls with lower WMC are less able to utilize executive control to ignore irrelevant or interfering information and maintain focus on a specific goal. whereas the opposite is true for high-WMC individulas.
  - working memory has an effect in speech processing, increase WM load has been shown to slow down spoken word recognition, high working memory individuals shown less perceptiual compensation for coaritculation and less biased toward hearing legal sound sequences than low working memeory individuals. 
2. cognitive processing style
- personality traits
- psychological dimensions representing preferences and consistencies in an indivudal's particulat manner of cognitive functioning (acquiring or processing information)
- recent studies found that across-indivudal variation in perceptual and production norms is determined in part by individual variability in cognitive processing style
  - traits associatd with the Autism-Spectrum Condition, reulst in deficits in social interaction, communicaiton, behavioral flexibility and affects 1% of the popultaion.
  - ASQ measures Autistic-like traits within the neruotypical population, which are individuals without clinically autisitc
  - negatively correalte with the extent of identification shift associated with the Ganong effect which is the bias in categorication in the direction of a known word.
  - Ganong effect（加农效应）是指在语音感知中，语音-语义互动导致的“词汇偏向”现象：当一个音位在语音上模糊不清、可被解释为两个音素之间（例如 /d/ 与 /t/ 的边界音）时，听者更倾向于把它知觉为能组成真实词的那个音素，从而将整个刺激听成一个现有词。
  - significantg assocaitions between autistic-like traits and perceptual compensation for contextual variation in speech (vocalic context, talker voice, phonotactic contexts)
  - higher ASQ = stronger perceptual compensation for coarticulation than those with lower ASQ
  - lower ASQ = stronger phonetactic effects on speech perception than higher ASQ
  - individuals with ASC shown to exhibit enhanced perceptual processing of fine-grained auditory information
  - more autistic-like trait-realted cognitive processing styles might be particularly sensitive to fine phonetic differences
  - cogntive theorties of autism hold that individuals with autism have difficulties intergrtating perceptual information with higher order language processing (weak central coherence), neurotypical individuals with higher AQ, even if they might be better at detecting fine phonetic details, they also might have difficulties utilizing the perceived fine phonetic differences in their own speech production to affect discernible phonetic imitation. 

## Background
- speakers will not imitate if the novel phonetic feature endangers phonetic contrasts (unaspirated vs. aspirated)
- socio-biological factors also play a role: Men imitate more than women in the map task, but less than women in the shadowing task. Language distances: greater imitation is found in same-dialect conversational pairs than in either different-dialect pairs or different L1 pairs. 

## Method
- Procedure
  - Production task with 3 blocks
    - baseline production block: produce 72 /p t k/ initial target words in random order in the sentence "say _ again"
    - words selected from CELEX2, evenly distributed by token frequency quartile and by initial consonant
    - exposure block: subjects heard a constructed first-person narrative in which the words were embedded, and the VOT of the target words in the story was extended by 100%

    - post-exposure test block, the participants need to produce the same word list again in a different randomized order
    - include questions about the subject's age, second language knwoledge assessment of own sexual orientation
      - 1 = exclusively heterosexual to 7 = exclusively homosexual
    - feelings towards the talker
      - 1 = very positive to 7 = very negative
    - likelihood of behaving in the same way in a similar situation (yes or no)
    - whether anything unusual was noticed in the talker's speech 
  - neurocognitive and personality measures
    - ASQ
      - 50 items (10 questions assessing 5 subscales: social skills, communication, attention to detail, attention-switching, imagination)
      - Likert scale 1-4 (original ASQ)
      - a total ASQ score was calculated by summing all the scores for each of the items
      - maximum score of 200, minimum score of 50
      - subscales: maximum score of 40, minimum score of 10
      - higher scores = traits associated with Autism
        - lower social skills, difficulty in attention switching/stronger focus of attention, higher attention to detail and patterns, lower ability to communicate, lower imagination
    - Big Five Inventory: five broad personality dimensions
      - Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
      - calculated as questions associated with the dimension
      - High AQ individuals are associated with high Neuroticism, low Extraversion, low Agreeableness, or low Conscientiousness
    - Automated Reading Span Task (RSPAN)
      - working memory capacity
      - sentences on computer (the ranger told the hiker to look out for snakes)
      - ask to indicate whether the sentence makes sense or not (True or False)
      - Then a letter was presented for participants to hold in memory
        - 75 letters in 15 sets
      - score calculated with the partial-credit unit scoring method
      - order is randomized 

## Participants 
- 93 subjects, 2 subjects were lost, 1 subject failed to follow the procedure, 6 participants did not finish the RSPAN or one of the questionnaires (AQ or Big Five)
- remaining 70 words by 84 subjects
- AQ score range 102 - 110.5, SD = 71-150 or 78-155

## Analyses
- Mixed-effect regression models are robust to unbalanced designs
- 2 Models
  1. The effects of properties of all factors on VOT, except whether the subject has heard the narrative yet or not
     - residuals of the model are VOT values that are normalized for speaking rate, properties of the host word, idiosyncratic by-subject and by-word differences
     - calculate the normalized VOT shift: the difference between the subject's pre-narrative and post-narrative normalized VOT values for the word
     - properties of the host word (word-level predictors)
     - individual utterance (utterance-level predictors)
     - narrative condition (outcome, sexuality)
     - subject (all other predictors)
    - fixed-effect terms: frequency, consonant, syllables, rate 1, and rate 2
    - by-subject random slopes for all five variables to allow for by-subject variability in the effect of each variable on VOT
    - VOT, CONSONANT+FREQUENCY+SYLLABLES+RATE1+RATE2+ TRIAL+TRIAL : BLOCK+(1+ CONSONANT+FREQUENCY+SYLLA-BLES+RATE1+ RATE2+ TRIAL+TRIAL : BLOCK D SUBJECT)+(1D WORD)
  2. The effects of subject-level variables (RSPAN, attitude towards the narrator) on the amount of shift
     - the value of its intercept = how much overall VOT shift occurs
     - Values of its coefficients describe how different subject-level variables affect the amount of the shift
     - Amount of the normalized VOT shift depends on subject-level predictors: the narrative outcome, the narrative's sexual orientation, the subject's gender, attitude towards the narrator, RSPAN, Big Five, ASQ
     - continuous predictors are centered
     - gender, sexuality, and outcome were sum-coded (contrast-coded)
     - SHIFT, GENDER + ATTITUDE + SEXUALITY + OUTCOME + RSPAN + O+ C + E + N + A + AS + SS + CM + IM + AD + (1D SUBJECT) + (1D WORD)

## Discussion
- subject with a positive attitude towards the narrator increase VOT more than subjects with a negative attitude towards the narrator
- dynamics of VOT imitation were modulated by speaker attitude and narrative outcome, but not speaker gender or perceived sexual orientation of the narrator
- Certain social and cognitive makeup of the subject strongly infleunce the extent of phonetic imitation
  - Greater sense of openness and strong attention focus tend to approximate the narrator's VOT more than those with the opposite personality and autistic-like traits
  - openness indexes an indivudal's level of engagement with perceptual, sensory, and abstract and semantic information
    - level of engagement with the exposure materials matters
  - more focused and are not accustomed to constant attention switching = high attention switching subcore of ASQ, more attuned to the fine-grained phonetic fluctuations in the exposure materials = increasing the chance of such phonetic attributes being imitated
