## Phonetic imitation from an individual-difference perspective: Subjective attitude, personality and “autistic” traits (Yu et al., 2013)

## My thoughts
- If working memory capacity is shown to have an effect on ignore irrelevant or interfering information and maintain focus on a specific goal, this seems to be an important factor for individual difference factors, but this paper did not found an significance on this
  - I should look for tasks on working memeory capacity.
  - working ememory capacity also affect sentence processing! (MacDonald MC, Christiansen MH (2002) Reassessing working memory: Comment on Just and Carpenter (1992) and Waters and Caplan (1996). Psychological Review 109: 35–54.)
    
## Summary 
Phonetic imitation: a process by which the production patterns of an individual become more similar on some phonetic or acoustic dimension to those of their interlocutor. This study looks at the phenomenon of phonetic imitation using a within-subject design embedded in an individual-differences framework (e.g., autism-spectrum, working memory, personality). Subjective perspectives on phonetic imitation, the participants assigned to one of the four experimental conditions: sexual orientation of the narrator, outcome of the story. They found that the extent of phonetic imitation by an individual is significantly modulated by the story outcome, by participant's subjeciyive attitude toward the model talker, and participant's personality trait of openness and the autistic-like trait associated with attention switching. 

##  Key Concepts
- phonetic imitation = convergence
- phonetic divergence = reverse process
- Communication Accommodtion Theory: speech convergence phenomena as motivated by an individual's desire for social acceptance and identification with a particular social group. 
- working memeory capacity (WMC): the ability to control attention and deal with irrelevant information, and not simply the amount of information that can reside in working memeory. = individual differences are not due to some limited amount of activation available to the working memory system but to an indicidual's ability to ignore irrelecant information (on the basis of a specific relevant goal) through the control of attention
  - individuls with lower WMC are less able to utilize executive control to ignore irrelevant or interfering information and maintain focus on a specific goal. whereas the opposite is true for high-WMC individulas.
  - working memory has an effect in speech processing, increase WM load has been shown to slow down spoken word recognition, high working memory individuals shown less perceptiual compensation for coaritculation and less biased toward hearing legal sound sequences than low working memeory individuals. 

## Background
- speakers will not imitate if the novel phonetic feature endangers phonetic constrasts (unaspirated vs. aspirated)
- socio-biological factors also play a role: Men imitate more than women in the map task, but lea=ss than women in the shadowing task. Language distances: greater imitation is found in same-dialet conversational pairs than in either different-dialect pairs or different L1 pairs.
