## My thoughts

## Summary 
Phonetic imitation: a process by which the production patterns of an individual become more similar on some phonetic or acoustic dimension to those of their interlocutor. This study looks at the phenomenon of phonetic imitation using a within-subject design embedded in an individual-differences framework (e.g., autism-spectrum, working memory, personality). Subjective perspectives on phonetic imitation, the participants assigned to one of the four experimental conditions: sexual orientation of the narrator, outcome of the story. They found that the extent of phonetic imitation by an individual is significantly modulated by the story outcome, by participant's subjeciyive attitude toward the model talker, and participant's personality trait of openness and the autistic-like trait associated with attention switching.
