## On empathic and logophoric binding (Oshima., 2007)

## Citation 
Oshima, D. Y. (2007). On empathic and logophoric binding. Research on language and computation, 5(1), 19-35.

## My thoughts

## Summary 
- It is well known that the notions of “logophoricity” and “point of view” are crucial factors for the licensing of certain anaphoric expressions
- These terms all happened to have overlapping definitions
- but empathy and logophoric perspectives should be separated, and both factors play important roles in binding
- there are three types of linguitics point of view
  - empathy
  - logophoricity
  - spatio-temporal = deicitc perspective 

## Emapthy and logophoricty 
- The notion of logophoricity was first pointed out, in the 70’s, on data from some African languages, which have a special kind of pronoun—logophoric pronouns—that appears in indirect discourse environments and exclusively refers to the agent of reported speech or thought. In certain languages (e.g., Japanese and Icelandic), so-called long-distance reflexives carry the same function (see Huang, 2000 for an overview).
- certain logophors have an extended use to represent the speaker's point of view or empathy which is the particiaptns of the described event
- the logophoric and empathic uses of referential expressions have been often confounded and grouped together
- however, there are at least two authors who makes the claim to seperate logophroticty and empathy, Kuno 1978 and Culy 1994, 1997

## What is empathy?
Kuno (1987) defines the notion of empathy as follows:
(1) Empathy: Empathy is the speaker’s identification, which may vary in degree, with a person/thing that participates in the event or state that he describes in a sentence.

Degree of Empathy: The degree of the speaker’s empathy with x, E(x), ranges from 0 to 1, with E(x) = 1 signifying his total identification with x, and E(x)= 0 a total lack of identification. (Kuno, 1987, p. 206)

- example: japanese verb yaru and kureru
  - yaru is used when the action is looked at from the point of view of the referent of the subject or the neutral (objective) point of view
  - kureru is used when the event is described from the point of view of the referent of the dative object

- empathy locus = the particiapnt that receivers the highest degree of empathy within a clause

- Topic Empathy Hierarchy:
  - Given an event or state involving A and B such that A is coreferential with the topic of the present discourse and B is not, it is easier for the speaker to empathize with A thank with B
 
- zibun has at least three distinct uses: reflexive, logophoric, and empathic (perspectival)
  - compatibility with first personpronouns
  - possibility of non-subject/discrouse binding
  - de se interprtion
