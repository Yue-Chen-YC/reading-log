## Structural and semantic constraints on the resolution of pronouns and reflexives (Kaiser et al., 2009)

## Citation 
Kaiser, E., Runner, J. T., Sussman, R. S., & Tanenhaus, M. K. (2009). Structural and semantic constraints on the resolution of pronouns and reflexives. Cognition, 112(1), 55-80.

## My thoughts
- Whether the source/perceiver should be a semantic, thematic role or a discourse-level/pragmatic manipulation
  
## Summary 

They conducted four experiments on the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives in picture noun phrases with and without possessors, and 2 offline and 2 visual world eye-tracking 

- They found that the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives in the picture NP condition is sensitive not to purely structural information, but also to semantic information
- Pronouns and reflexives differ in the degree of sensitivity they exhibit to different kinds of information
- Indicate a form-specific multiple-constraints appraoch
- referential forms have asymmetrical sensisitives to the different constraints guiding reference resolution and also applies within-sentence domain

## Research Questions
- how syntactic and semantic factors will guide the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives
- How is different information integrated during real-time reference resolution 

## Introduction 
- It's common to assume that the choice of the referent for a reflexive like herself is specified by the structural configuration of the sentence
- Many research have argued that semantic informaiton infleucnes the interpreation of pronouns with cross-clasual antecedent
- Stevenson and colleagues (Stevenson et al., 1994) found that the thematic role of an enity (agent, goal, source, experiencer) infleunces its likelyhood of being the antecedent for a subsequent pronoun (also see Arnold, 2001)
- which suggested that referential expressions tend to fall into two groups, one is the strucutre princple and another one is the non-strcuture factors such as semantics and discourse.
- multiple-constraints frame-work, first introduced in Kaiser (2003) (see also Brown-Schmidt, Byron, & Tanenhaus, 2005; Kaiser, 2005; Kaiser & Trueswell, 2008)
  - The anaphor resolution is not determined by a single constraint but rather is the result of the interaction of multiple constraints
  - allow for multiple constraints that guide reference resolution to be weighted differently for different referntial forms
  - example: Finnish pronouns and demonstratives can be used to refer to human antecedent mentioned in the preceding clause, but do not show the same level of sensitity to the antecedent's syntactic role and linear position
 
## Picture NP
- the reflelxive and pronouns in the picture NP are exempt from the binding principle, and they should be taken account with semantics and discrouse roles
- Reflexives in possessed PNPs can refer to the subject of the sentence, which is contrary to the predicitions of the strucutral appraoch
- 2 appraoches
 - Agument Binding Theory in order to maintain a primarily strcutural account of the distribution of pronouns and refelxvies
 - treat some anaphors (especially reflexives in possessorless PNPs) are being exempt from Binding Theory altoghether and guided by semantic and discrouse constraints

## 1.2. Semantic and discourse factors
- Reflexives in possessorless PNPs have been argued to be sensitive to factors such as the potential antecedents’ point of view, degree of awareness and semantic role (e.g., Kuno, 1987; Pollard & Sag, 1992).
- Kuno, 1987 mentioned that reflexive can felicitously refer to Mary becuase she is the one who provides John the informaiton, which makes Mary of source of the sentence, and pronouns and refelxvies are both sensitive to the point of view, which means they have a preference for antecedents that are either source or the perceivers of informaiton.
- a purely structural approach is insufficient to capture their referential properties, especially in pos-sessorless PNPs.

## 1.3. General aims of this paper
1. how strcutural and semantic constrqints infleucnes pariticiapnts' final interpreations of pronouns and reflexvies
2. the time-course with which different constraints infleucne the processing of these forms
3. complement and extend exisiting work by testing whether the source and perceiver hypotheses are supported by experimental data for the on-line interpreation of posseorless PNP as well as for PNP
4. test the asymmetrical sensitvitiy that the form-specific multiple-constraints appraoch permits also applies to the within-sentence domain and whether strcutural and semantic constraints show wualitativiely dfferet behavior during real-time processing
5. the relative weights of syntactic and semantic informaiton: how much of an infleucne does semantic informaiton exert on the interpretation of pronouns and refelxvies, as compared to the infleucne of syntactic information?

(7b) Peter heard from John about the picture of himself/ him on the wall

- create situations in which structural constraints and non-structure constraints are pitted against each other as well as they are aligned and favor the same antecedent

## 1.4. Nature of the relation between structural and semantic constraints

- If both syntactic and semantic constraints play a role, and if their relative weights are the same for pronouns as for reflexives, then we predict that in sentences like (7a) and (7b):

**(i)** with pronouns, there will be more subject interpretations with hear than with tell (based on the perceiver preference hypothesis in (6))
**(ii)** with reflexives, there will be more object interpretations with hear than with tell (based on the source preference hypothesis in (4))
**(iii)** if the relative weights of structural and semantic information are the same for pronouns and reflexives, the proportion of subject and object choices triggered by one form should be ‘mirrored’ by the proportion of subject and object choices triggered by the other form. In other words, whatever levels of sensitivity reflexives show to structural and to semantic information, pronouns will show the same levels of sensitivity.

-  real-time language processing is continuously guided by multiple weighted constraints
-  we expect to see early effects of both structural and semantic constraints and can observe when potential asymmetries in the constraint weights for pronouns and reflexives emerge during real-time processing
