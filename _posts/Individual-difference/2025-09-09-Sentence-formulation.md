## Sentence formulation is easier when thematic and syntactic prominence align: evidence from psych verbs (Do & Kaiser., 2022)

## Citation 
Do, M. L., & Kaiser, E. (2022). Sentence formulation is easier when thematic and syntactic prominence align: evidence from psych verbs. Language, Cognition and Neuroscience, 37(5), 648-670.

## My thoughts


## Summary 
- use visual world eye-tracking to investigate how the mapping from thematic event strcutures to grammatical strcutures (sentence formulation), unfolds during real time sentence production
- found speakers were feaster to begin speaking and to preferentially fxiate the subject when they were able to assign the thematically prominent experiencer role to the subejct of the sentence
- sentence formulation is easier when speakers can make sue of a tight, systematic correspondence between event structure and lingusitic strcutures
