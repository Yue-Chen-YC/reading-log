## Perspective and long-distance binding of chinese reflexvies (Jyu., 2025)

## Citation 

## My thoughts
- LD ziji is a logophor exempt, becuase it's a prespective center
- ta-ziji is an anphor, beucse it's inflenced by the binding constraints

## Introduction 
- the topic empathy hierarchy (Kuno, 1987)

## Research Questions 
- wehther ziji and ta-ziji is infleunced by the discourse prespective?
- compare the simialries and differences of ziji and ta-ziji in terms of ld binding
- based on experimental results and analysis the discrouse topcality, logophoriticy hierarchy and adverbs and their infleunces to LD binding 

## results
- taziji is more diffciult fo be used as a logophor, becuase it needs salient prespective center compared to ziji
- both reflexives is inflenced by the perspective

## Method
- antecedent judgment experimetns
- experiment 1:
  - discourse topcality of its infleunce to LD binding
  - 2 x 2 factorial design
  - type of refelxive, the discourse topic charater (source or preceiver)
  - LD or local antencedent
- results: main effect for type of reflexive, LD ziji is higher than LD ta-ziji
  - main effect for discourse topic, when the LD antecedendt is the source, the LD binding is higher, which means the LD binding of the two types of reflexibves is infleunced by the logophoricity hierarchy, which aligns with cross-linguistics studies form other languahges such as English
  - the interaction is more salient, which means there is no effect of discourse topic on two types of reflexives
  - antecedent choice: people more likely to choose the LD antecdent for condition of ziji/source, ziji/preceiver, and ta-ziji/source, but there is no differences fro ta-ziji/preceiver
  - 他自己需要一个强视角才可以充当话者指示词
- experiment 2:
  - adverb and reflexives, wehther the adverbs which reflect the speakers' attitude and cognitive status will infleunce the binding of the two reflexives
  - 2 x 2 desgin
  - refelxive type, types of adverbs
  - results: when there is no context sentences. the local binding for ziji and taziji are stronger than experiment 1, there is a main effect for reflexive type, which means the ld binding for ziji is higher than taziji, there is also a main effect for types of adverbs, which means the LD binding is higher when there is an adverb compared to there is no adverbs
  - the interaction between adverb and reflexive is not significant
  - there is less infleunce on adverbs and taziji, only boost up 4%
  - support results from experiment one, which taziji needs more salient disocurse topic in order to achieve the LD binding
- experiment 3:
  - adverb and reflexives multipe choices
  - results: main effect for refelxive type, local binding for ziji is higher than taziji
  - main effect for adverbs, with adverbs increase the proportion of local binding for both reglexives

## Conclusion and disscussion 
- both ziji and taziji are related to prespecives and ziji is more inleuncted by prespectives compared to ta-ziji
- ziji and taziji can both be logophor, becuase under the source condition, they are both more likley to refer to the LD antecedent
- does not support head movement, becuase the adverbs are pragmatic factors
- the difference between ziji and taziji is that taziji is more difficult to be referred to LD antecedent
- LD antecedent of taziji is infleucned by discourse topacality, which does not support pan hai hua's prespective that semantic saliency is ranked over syntactic saliency, such as the animacy of the antecedent
- topcality, logophorcity hieracry and adverbs, all three factors will infleunce the LD binding for ziji and taziji
- based on the results, we found that discourse topicality is more salient comapred to logophoricity and adverbs
- discourse topic is based on the context sentences, bascially they found that without context sentences the effect is smaller compared with context sentence = so the dicourse topic factor is stronger compared to ther other two: logophoricty, source and preceiver, and adverbs are with adverbs or without adverbs
- something to do with the empathy locus and attitude holder, we can deivde prespectives into the empathy locus and the attitude holder
- empathy locus is more suitable than attitude holder as a discourse topic
