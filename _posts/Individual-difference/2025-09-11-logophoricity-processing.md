## My thoughts

## Summary 
- This study investigates the linguistic properties of two reflexive pronoun in Chinese, ziji and ta-ziji
- how the use the LD/exempt of these reflexives relates to the notion of perspective-taking or logophoricity
- offline forced-choice judgment
- online self-paced reading
- found both reflexives are sensitive to the discourse topical status and the loophoric role (source/perceiver) of their long-distance antecedents
- realted to the discrouse topicality and the lofophiric hierarchy to perspective-taking and posit that perspective taking is a unifyinf factor that drives the exempt use of these two reflexvies
- they also differ siglightly that ta-ziji requires a more prominnent perspective center than ziji does
- during incremental processing, different types of discourse infroamtion can be accessed at different processing stages

## Introduction 
- logophoricity refers to the property of some pronouns called logophoricity pronouns, which are anchored to individuals whose thoughts, feelings, and general states of consciousnss are reported
  - shown in some West Afarican languages, and some LD reflexives such as Icelandic, Japanese, and Chinese

- Due to this connection, long-distance reflexvies referring to perspective centers are widely called logophoric reflevies or exempt reflexives
- ziji can have an exempt use which means they are sensitive to logophoricity
- complex ta-ziji is often a local anaphor constrained by Principle A

## Jyu & Kaiser 2024
- Tested discourse topicality and effects of self-directed (fabioa ‘publish’) and other-directed verb (pigai ‘grade’) and their interaction with the bare and compound reflexives in Mandarin. 
- They found that Chinese speakers prefer non-local binding with other-directed verbs and local binding with self-directed verbs. There is a main effect of verb bias, which means the participants are more likely to choose a non-local subject when the embedded verb is other-directed. They also found a source advantage for reflexives, which aligns with previous studies, but the source preference is only present with self-directed verbs. 
- But the notion of self-directed and other-directed verbs is not well explained. We expect whether the effect will still be  present if we use the well-defined psych verbs, such as SE and ES verbs, and their interaction with the thematic hierarchy

Experiment 1a
- they argue that exempt use of xiji id gradiently sensitive to the logophoric hierarchy, which means the gradience is refelected in the fact that the logophoric hierarchy does not categorically rule in or rule out bidning by the perspective center  
  - this aligns with previous findings for exempt reflexives in Dutch, German and English
  - Our finding that sources are preferred over pervceivers shows that the predictions derived from the logophoric hierarchy which Culy 1994 proposed based on logophoric pronouns in pure logophoric languages such as Ewe, will also apply to perspective-sensitive reflexived in mixed logophotic languages such as Chinese.
