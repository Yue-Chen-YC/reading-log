## My thoughts

## Summary 
- This study investigates the linguistic properties of two reflexive pronoun in Chinese, ziji and ta-ziji
- how the use the LD/exempt of these reflexives relates to the notion of perspective-taking or logophoricity
- offline forced-choice judgment
- online self-paced reading
- found both reflexives are sensitive to the discourse topical status and the loophoric role (source/perceiver) of their long-distance antecedents
- realted to the discrouse topicality and the lofophiric hierarchy to perspective-taking and posit that perspective taking is a unifyinf factor that drives the exempt use of these two reflexvies
- they also differ siglightly that ta-ziji requires a more prominnent perspective center than ziji does
- during incremental processing, different types of discourse infroamtion can be accessed at different processing stages
