## My thoughts

## Summary 

- antecedent of logophoric pronoun must be the one
  - whose speech, thoughts, feelings or general state of consciensness are reported
  - logophoric pronouns = predicates of communicaiton and mental experience
 
- discrouse representaiton strcutures framework (Hans Kamp, 1981)
  - verbs of propositional attitude
  - source = the source of reporter
  - self = the pronoun with repect to whose consciousness
  - point of view = PIVOT = person from whose point of view the report is made
 
- logophoric pronouns are also sometimws possible with verbs of mental state or attitude


- the verb say determines that its subject may be the antecedent for the logophoric pronoun

- Celement suggests that the source of the communicaiton is relevant for determine logophoricity

- the logophoric pronoun in Ewe may appear niether in a relative clause or in the complement ot a perception verb

- there are certain differences between verbs of saying and psychological predicates, through which the speaker reportes on the mental state of some sentence-internal referent

The lexical representation of say will contrast with that of a psych-verb like distress, which is a predicate through which the external speaker reports the state of mind of some interal protagonist
