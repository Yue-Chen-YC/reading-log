## My thoughts

## Summary 
The main goal of this dissertation is to use experiments to examine how syntactic factors (e.g., locality, syntactic position) and non-syntactic factors (e.g., verb semantics, perspectival information) impact reflexive resolution in Chinese and how these factors influence real-time processing, to re-examine conventional linguistic judgment and more importantly, to provide new data contributing to the advances of linguistic theories. 

## The antecedent choice judgment results: 
- ziji and ta-ziji are subject to syntactic, semantic, and discourse-level constraints, but the extent to which discourse topic prominence impacts the interpretation of ziji and ta-ziji differs.
- Ziji is mroe heavily infleunced by the discrouse topic status of the potential antecedent compared to ta-ziji (ziji is perspective-sensitive (empathic) while ta-ziji is not)

## Self-paced reading results 
- When discourse-level information is considered in the experimental design, syntax does not play a predominant role in antecedent retrieval
- more consistent with standard retrieval model (but it can not predcit the absence of the object blocking effect)

## Abstract 
A reflexive pronoun depends on another referent in the discourse for interpretation, and when multiple referents exist, the readers need to identify which referent the reflexive is to be anchored to. 

## Key Concepts
2 types of reflexive in Chinese
- morphologically simple/bare reflexive ziji ('self')
- morphonologically complex/compound ta-ziji ('s/he-self')

object blocking effect
- when a 1st person pronoun (sentence-external perspective center) in the object position cannot block long-distance binding by a discourse topic empathy locus (sentence-internal perspective center)

## Introduction
- The referent that the reflexive anchors to is called the antecedent; the process of disambiguating the reflexive is called reflexive resolution
- The process of locating the antecedent is constrained not only by the human cognitive architecture but also by the linguistic properties of reflexives, so reflexive resolution is a bridge that brings cognitive architecture and linguistics theories together
- There are in-depth theorizing about the syntactic and discourse-pragmatic constraints that govern the interpretation of Mandarin reflexives (e.g., Pan, 1997, 1998, 2001; Pollard & Xue, 1998, 2001; Huang & Liu, 2001; Anand, 2006; Cole et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2009; Wang & Pan, 2014, 2015a,b; Giblin, 2016; Charnavel et al., 2017), there are relatively few studies examining these theroatical approach from a testable experimental approach (but see e.g., Schumacher et al., 2011; He & Kaiser, 2016; Han, 2020; Liu, 2020)

## 2 competing antecedent retrieval models debated in the sentence processing literature 
- Central question: whether syntactic information is prioritized over non-syntactic information (e.g., gender, number, animacy) in early-stage processing
1. the standard cue-based retrieval model (e.g., Lewis & Vasishth, 2005; Van Dyke & McElree, 2006; Chen et al., 2012; JÃ¤ger et al., 2015; Patil et al., 2016)
2. the structure-based retrieval model (e.g., Sturt, 2003; Xiang et al., 2009; Van Dyke & McElree, 2011; Dillon et al., 2013; Cunnings & Sturt, 2014; Parker & Phillips, 2017)

## Research Background
- Long-distance binding of ziji
  - One key linguistic property of ziji is that it can be exempt from Binding Principle A (Chomsky, 1981, 1986) or the locality constraint
  - Binding Principle A: A reflexive must be bound in its local domain (e.g., the smallest XP of the sentence, such as DP, TP, CP that contains a subject and a reflexive)
  - Linguistics noted early on that ziji can be free in the local domain and can be referred to a non-local antecedent (e.g., Huang et al., 1984; Battistella, 1989; Tang, 1989; Yu, 1992; Xu, 1993)
  - Exempt anaphor: Charnavel (2020) posits that plain (local) anaphors which is bound by overt antecedents, and exempt (long-distance) anaphors which is bound by covert logophoric operators, are simply bound by different antecedents.
  - Earlier syntactic approaches hold that LD ziji is only apparently non-local, but underlyingly locally bound, as ziji moves cyclically at the logical form (LF) to adjoin to a position that has a local relationship to its target antecedent (e.g., Battistella, 1989; Huang & Tang, 1991; Cole et al., 1990, 1993; Cole & Sung, 1994; Cole & Wang, 1996).

- Two analyses, but similar to an agreement-based account
-  Head-movement analysis (presented by Cole et al., 1990): ziji moves up the tree to adjoin with the T2 head and percolates its [+3] feature to T2, because T in Chinese is arguably vacuous, after which subject-verb agreement for TP2 can proceed, ziji then moves through all the head positions to the next TP layer to feed subject-verb agreement in TP1.
- XP-adjunction analysis (Huang and Tang, 1991), which is implemented differently but close in spirit.
