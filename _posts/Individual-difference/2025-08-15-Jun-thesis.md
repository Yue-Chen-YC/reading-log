## My thoughts

## Summary 
The main goal of this dissertation is to use experiments to examine how syntactic factors (e.g., locality, syntactic position) and non-syntactic factors (e.g., verb semantics, perspectival information) impact reflexive resolution in Chinese and how these factors influence real-time processing, to re-examine conventional linguistic judgment and more importantly, to provide new data contributing to the advances of linguistic theories. 

## The antecedent choice judgment results: 
- ziji and ta-ziji are subject to syntactic, semantic, and discourse-level constraints, but the extent to which discourse topic prominence impacts the interpretation of ziji and ta-ziji differs.
- Ziji is more heavily influenced by the discourse topic status of the potential antecedent compared to ta-ziji (ziji is perspective-sensitive (empathic) while ta-ziji is not)

## Self-paced reading results 
- When discourse-level information is considered in the experimental design, syntax does not play a predominant role in antecedent retrieval
- more consistent with the standard retrieval model (but it can not predict the absence of the object blocking effect)

## Abstract 
A reflexive pronoun depends on another referent in the discourse for interpretation, and when multiple referents exist, the readers need to identify which referent the reflexive is to be anchored to. 

## Key Concepts
**2 types of reflexive in Chinese**
- morphologically simple/bare reflexive ziji ('self')
- morphonologically complex/compound ta-ziji ('s/he-self')

object blocking effect
- when a 1st person pronoun (sentence-external perspective center) in the object position cannot block long-distance binding by a discourse topic empathy locus (sentence-internal perspective center)

## Introduction
- The referent that the reflexive anchors to is called the antecedent; the process of disambiguating the reflexive is called reflexive resolution
- The process of locating the antecedent is constrained not only by the human cognitive architecture but also by the linguistic properties of reflexives, so reflexive resolution is a bridge that brings cognitive architecture and linguistics theories together
- There are in-depth theorizing about the syntactic and discourse-pragmatic constraints that govern the interpretation of Mandarin reflexives (e.g., Pan, 1997, 1998, 2001; Pollard & Xue, 1998, 2001; Huang & Liu, 2001; Anand, 2006; Cole et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2009; Wang & Pan, 2014, 2015a,b; Giblin, 2016; Charnavel et al., 2017), there are relatively few studies examining these theroatical approach from a testable experimental approach (but see e.g., Schumacher et al., 2011; He & Kaiser, 2016; Han, 2020; Liu, 2020)

## 2 competing antecedent retrieval models debated in the sentence processing literature 
- **Central question**: whether syntactic information is prioritized over non-syntactic information (e.g., gender, number, animacy) in early-stage processing
1. the standard cue-based retrieval model (e.g., Lewis & Vasishth, 2005; Van Dyke & McElree, 2006; Chen et al., 2012; Jäger et al., 2015; Patil et al., 2016)
2. the structure-based retrieval model (e.g., Sturt, 2003; Xiang et al., 2009; Van Dyke & McElree, 2011; Dillon et al., 2013; Cunnings & Sturt, 2014; Parker & Phillips, 2017)

## Research Background
- **Long-distance binding of ziji**
  - One key linguistic property of ziji is that it can be exempt from Binding Principle A (Chomsky, 1981, 1986) or the locality constraint
  - Binding Principle A: A reflexive must be bound in its local domain (e.g., the smallest XP of the sentence, such as DP, TP, CP that contains a subject and a reflexive)
  - Linguistics noted early on that ziji can be free in the local domain and can be referred to a non-local antecedent (e.g., Huang et al., 1984; Battistella, 1989; Tang, 1989; Yu, 1992; Xu, 1993)
  - Exempt anaphor: Charnavel (2020) posits that plain (local) anaphors which is bound by overt antecedents, and exempt (long-distance) anaphors which covert logophoric operators bind, are simply bound by different antecedents.
  - Earlier syntactic approaches hold that LD ziji is only apparently non-local, but underlyingly locally bound, as ziji moves cyclically at the logical form (LF) to adjoin to a position that has a local relationship to its target antecedent (e.g., Battistella, 1989; Huang & Tang, 1991; Cole et al., 1990, 1993; Cole & Sung, 1994; Cole & Wang, 1996).

- **Two analyses, but similar to an agreement-based account**
-  **Head-movement analysis** (presented by Cole et al., 1990): ziji moves up the tree to adjoin with the T2 head and percolates its [+3] feature to T2, because T in Chinese is arguably vacuous, after which subject-verb agreement for TP2 can proceed, ziji then moves through all the head positions to the next TP layer to feed subject-verb agreement in TP1.
- XP-adjunction analysis (Huang and Tang, 1991), which is implemented differently but close in spirit.
- 我的想法：这个的确和agreement很像，所以是自己agree with王老师和小明的3-person feature，所以可以refer到两个antecedent，但是感觉这个没有解释为什么这个可以LD bound? 只是说agreement
- 这个local relationship我没有看出来在哪里
- yaqing的解释：ziji本来是base-generate在最下面的NP那里，这时候就是local bound；但是在LF,ziji也可以继续往上move，跑到xiaoming下面的位置的时候，其实也是local bound；但是在LF上的movement我们是看不见的，所以就理解成long-distance bound （如果往上move的话感觉的确可以解释是local bound，理解了）

 - **Problems with the blocking effect**:
 - 小明，听说我喜欢自己。vs. 小明，听说你喜欢自己 （自己可以是你，但是不可以是小明, ziji can be referred to you, but not xiaoming）
   - blocking effect crashed due to subject-verb agreement
   - ziji is generated with a [+1] person feature or gets its phi-feature from the local 'I' in TP
   - After it moves to TP1 layer and precolates its [+1] feature to T1, subject-verb agreement crashes because the matrix subject has an incompatible [+3] person feature
 - 小明告诉我，王教授喜欢自己。vs. 小明告诉你，王教授喜欢自己。（自己可以是你，但是不能是小明, ziji can be referred to you, but not xiaoming）
 - This approach predicts an object should not block LD binding, because an object blocker is not in a structural (e.g., subject) position to pass its phi-feature to ziji (showing that there should not be an object blocking effect, which is contrary to  小明告诉我，王教授喜欢自己。vs. 小明告诉你，王教授喜欢自己)

 - **Recent Approach**
   - Giblin (2016) offers a syntactic solution to the object blocking effect
   - **Discourse-Based Account**: Before Giblin (2016), researchers proposed that discourse factors, such as perspective or point of view, play a critical role in LD binding of ziji and the blocking effect
     - if we assume ziji is perspective-sensitive = non-local antecedents can bind ziji when they are perspective centers or domains of point of view
       - a perspective center can be:
         - attitude holder = a person whose perspective or point of view the sentence expresses
         - empathy locus = a person whose perspective the speaker takes
         - 我的想法：attitude holder算是 source / perciver吗？empathy locus可以是 empathy verb 怕吗？
      - Mandarin LD ziji is empathic = one must put themselves in the shoes of the perspective holder = the antecedent of ziji needs to be an empathy locus
      - empathy = speaker's identification, with varying degrees, with a person who participates in the event that he describes in a sentence (Kuno & Kaburaki, 1977: 628)
    - Empathy locus and its interaction with the blocking effect
      - I or you encodes the speaker's own perspective, then it means that LD ziji with the sentence-internal Xiaoming and sentence-external I or you includes a clash of perspectives
      - 我的想法：为什么 小明是sentence- internal，i or you 是sentence-external？
      - jun的解释：Speech Act Empathy Hierarchy (Kuno, 1987: 212)
        - The speaker cannot empathize with someone else more than with himself (speaker只能对自己更empathize比起其他人)
        - 这个approach好的地方是可以解释object blocking effect and subject blocking effect
      - overall: perspective-taking can infleunce the reflexive resolution of ziji

## 2 research questions 
1. Does the discourse role (e.g., source vs. perceiver) of the perspective center impact LD binding of ziji?
2. Is there a syntactic component to the blocking effect?
