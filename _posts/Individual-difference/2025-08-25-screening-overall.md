## My thoughts 

## Competition between Empathy, Logophor, and animacy hierarchies 
Based on previous research from theoretical work, which shows that ziji is both empathic and logophoric, and from experimental work, Liu (2020) found that ziji is logophoric, while Xue & Runner (submitted) found that ziji is not logophoric. 
1. Empathy hierarchy (Hu, 2019)
- Empathy verb > non-empathy verb (source and perciver verbs)
2. Logophority hierarchy
- Source > Self > Pivot (Huang & Liu, 2001)
- Speech > thought > knowledge > direct perception (Culy, 1994; 1062)
3. Animacy Hierarchy (Hu, 2019)
- Empathy hierarchy > Animacy hierarchy
- Animate + human noun > animate noun > inanimate noun
  - then it shows that if the empathy hierarchy is true, then faster reaction time for the empathy verb compared to the source and preceiver verb
  - If the animacy hierarchy is true, then animate + human nouns have faster reaction times than animate -human nouns
  - then we expect the fastest reaction time to the empathy and animate +human noun condition
    - lowest reaction time to the perceiver and inanimate noun condition

## My thoughts 
- 3 x 3 design?
- fear verb, source verb, preceiver verb (pa, shuo, gaosu)
- animate noun, collective noun, animate plural noun (John, university, friends) 
  -  ziji maybe more likely to bound withe singular nouns like john, and if we do not add another level of plural nouns, this might be a part of nature for the collective noun, since they maybe plural by nature, and this maybe a confounding varible.
 

## Before experiment 
- ask participants to rate the animacy AND plurality of the nouns first from 1-10 to create a gradient effect, becuase some collective nouns maybe more animate than others, then select the top-rated collective nouns from the survey

## experiment 
- reaction time
  - Self-paced reading
- individual difference 
  - ASQ
  - Big five personabilities?
  - working memeory? eventhough they did not find a significance, but based on their research seems to be relevant?

## Hypothesis
- verb > animacy
  - Animacy will not affect the reaction time
  - fear verb faster than source and faster than preceiver (fear > source > preceiver)

- animacy > verb
  - verb will not affect the reaction time
  - animate noun > collective > animate plural noun 
  
- animacy x verb interaction (multiple constraint)
  - Animacy will affect the reaction time and interact with the verb condition
  - fear + animate noun = fastest > fear + collective > fear + animate plural noun ....
