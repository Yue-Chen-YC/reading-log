## My thoughts 
- 3 x 3 design ?
- fear verb, source verb, preceiver verb (pa, shuo, gaosu)
- animate noun, collective noun, animate plural noun (John, university, friends) 
  -  ziji maybe more likely to bound withe singular nouns like john, and if we do not add another level of plural nouns, this might be a part of nature for the collective noun, since they maybe plural by nature, and this maybe a confounding varible.
 

## Before experiment 
- ask participants to rate the animacy AND plurality of the nouns first from 1-10 to create a gradient effect, becuase some collective nouns maybe more animate than others, then select the top-rated collective nouns from the survey

## experiment 
- reaction time
  - Self-paced reading
- individual difference 
  - ASQ
  - Big five personabilities?
  - working memeory? eventhough they did not find a significance, but based on their research seems to be relevant?

## Hypothesis
- verb > animacy
  - Animacy will not affect the reaction time
  - fear verb faster than source and faster than preceiver (fear > source > preceiver)

- animacy > verb
  - verb will not affect the reaction time
  - animate noun > collective > animate plural noun 
  
- animacy x verb interaction (multiple constraint)
  - Animacy will affect the reaction time and interact with the verb condition
  - fear + animate noun = fastest > fear + collective > fear + animate plural noun ....
