## My thoughts


## Summary
This paper found evidence for a predicted interference effect in retroactive configurations, but no interference in proactive configurations. 


## Introduction 

Cue-based retrieval suggests that the parser initiates a search for the relevant linguistic dependent at the retrieval site such as the verb based on a set of retrieval cues. 

Whether the distractor must intervene between the co-dependents (e.g., retroactive interference) or whether the disctractor can appear to the left of the dependent elements (e.g., proactive interference). 

Previous work shown that proactive interference is weaker than retroactive interference, which means the distractor has to intervene between the co-dependents to infleunce the dependency completion process.
