## My thoughts

## Backgorund 
Huettig et al. (2010) found that Mandarin-speaking L1-dominant adults in a visual world eye-tracking study showed that linguistic stimuli that had a classifier compatible with the target noun in the visual scene facilitated processing (look at the target faster) relative to linguistic stimuli without a classifier. 
Li et al. (2021) used EEG and looked at adult Mandarin-speaking L1-dominant speakers and Mandarin HSs living in Malaysia to look at the processing of isolated classifier-noun pairs. They found that HSs used classifiers to predict and integrate the upcoming nouns to the same extent as the L1-dominant speakers. A larger N400 effect was found in classifier-noun mismatch than in classifier-noun match.
Gruter et al. (2020) found that for both L1 and L2ers, the G+S+ condition induced more looks to the competitor than the G-S+ condition, and the G-S+ condition induced more competition than G-S- condition only for the L2ers, which could be the case that L2ers may rely heavier on semantic information.
Studies focus on the production of classifiers in Mandarin HS have shown that several language background factors modulate HS's performance, which include more HL exposure and use (Kan, 2019), later age of onset of Acquisition (AoA) of the majority language, and having HL schooling. 

## Hypothesis 
If the processing of classifiers is primarily driven by semantic features, objects/nouns that have semantic features associated with that classifier (S+) should receive more looks relative to the ones that do not (S-).

## Method
Adopts the method used by Gruter et al. (2020), to examine the processing of Mandarin sortal classifiers in Mandarin adult HSs living in a society where English is the dominant language, and aims to address two research questions: 
1. At the group level, what are the performance patterns of Mandarin-English HSs on an eye-tracking task examining Mandarin sortal classifiers? What is the status of classifiers as grammatical (-G, +G) and semantic cues (-S, +S) in HSs' mental grammars and sentence processing?
2. How do individual-level bilingual language experience factors modulate HSs' performances?

Tests 
- Visual World Eye-tracking
- LSBQ questionnaire
- Elicited production
