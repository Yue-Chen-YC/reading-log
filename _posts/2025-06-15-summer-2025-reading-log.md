## My thoughts

## Backgorund 
Huettig et al. (2010) found that Mandarin-speaking L1-dominant adults in a visual world eye-tracking study showed that linguistic stimuli that had a classifier compatible with the target noun in the visual scene facilitated processing (look at the target faster) relative to linguistic stimuli without a classifier. 
Li et al. (2021) used EEG and looked at adult Mandarin-speaking L1-dominant speakers and Mandarin HSs living in Malaysia to look at the processing of isolated classifier-noun pairs. They found that HSs used classifiers to predict and integrate the upcoming nouns to the same extent as the L1-dominant speakers. A larger N400 effect was found in classifier-noun mismatch than in classifier-noun match.

## Hypothesis 
If the processing of classifiers is primarily driven by semantic features, objects/nouns that have semantic features associated with that classifier (S+) should receive more looks relative to the ones that do not (S-).
