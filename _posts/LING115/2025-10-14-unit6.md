## English as a global language
- future of English as a global language
  - is it likely that English would remain as the world's GL, how will it develop further as a language  

## 3 types of serios we may not use English internationally
- other languages become GL: spanish and mandarin chinese
  - Spanish has 500 million speakers worldwide and offical languages over 20 countries
  - we don't find large number of spanish speaker in Asia
  - Spanish is not in a strong position of taking English as a global language
  - Mandarin Chinese has over 1.1 billion speakers
  - maybe two major chanllages
    - 1. demopgrhaic = speakers are locations, similar as Spanish, they are very centered in the East Asia, but not in Africa or other countries, no signs of number of speakers will go up in the next 20 years 
      2. linguistics issues = the major feature of Chinese is complex and difficult to learn and master
         - Chinese is very difficult for speakers of English
         1. pronounicaitons = tone languages, pronounce with different intonation patterns and contours, when you learn every word, you need to know what it's pronounced such as tones
             - wrong tone, the words become different, in english we have longer words highlight with stress,
          - many syllables may mean different things (e.g., hollophoens), one syllable in English can be spelled with different meaning (e.g., sight, cite)
            - large number of hollomphones in Chinese, whole story is created with a single syllable
        2. writing system: chinese is written with chinese characters, for each word and character you need learn different symbols
           - most complex writing system in the world, but learning chinese requires a large amount of time and comittiment
           - do people have time and motivetion learning chinese?
           - due to these challanges, chinese doesn't seem to be replace english 
- machine translation and technology that could replace the need of international language
  - would AI replace english and funciton as a golbal language
  - machine and software can be created
  - english is used as a common language and link language around the world
  - can machine translation can replace english = phones, apps, able to use them in communicaiotn with your first language when you are communicating with different languages = maybe replace english from this role
  - current forms of language software
    - Google Translate = written input, type in one language and ask to translate into another language
      - works with written input
    - spoken language: as they listen to you and they will try to decode of what you are speaking
      - zoom recording = written respontation, need to work well with machine translaiton
      - the issue is accuracy, relating to the accuracy in step 1 and step 2, recognizing spoken languages correctly, different issues in translation
    - speech recognition = accuracy reaches high levels and the auccracy drops
      - accuracy also maintain at a high level
      - speech recognization if you speak in a majority dialect, regional forms goes down very dramaticlly
      - high level accuracy result, we can find for english, french, gernman, spanish, mandarin chinese
        - something can replace english, and interact with people with a large number of speakers, other progress of other language is very poor, this is unlikely to happen for some time
        - names or less familar words
        - translation = we need devices that can translate to different languages
          - between languages, english to french, the accuracy is reasonable, if you make the sentence more complex, then the accuracy tends to drop
          - require a huge amount of time
          - gives back grammatical sentence in English and the meaning is not the same
      - the thrid problem can never be solved = time-lag problem, translate after a person produce a sentence, deal with face to face communciaiton
      - slow form of communciaiton if it's neccessary, if you are traveling, then you might use it as a subsitde, then people will not be willing to slow down with this kind of communicaitons
      - how do we know machine is translating in a correct way 
- would english disppear as a single language in the future
  - english has been spoken for sometime for L2, and there are regional divergence for outer countries
  - can english diverge and become a set of languages
    - like latin becomes french and english
    - if you grow up in Asian, the model is typical standard american english
    - non-standardized form of English = ganaan, singaporean
  - the outer circles and new world englishes
    - local differences in english vocabulary, gramnmar and pronoucniaiton/accent
      - lexical 
      - west africa = next tomorrow
      - difficult for people whose unfamilar with these words
    - Singlish (singapore) = speakers in singapore, you may not understand what they are communicating
    - goverment probiddened to use Singlish on TV and program
    - we may see english split up, and become a language family rather than a single language
    - do we think it's going to happen? what we can observe is from outer countries is quit distinctive ways
      - there is a hope, this will be bidialectlism, people can speak 2 varities of english, one be the local form and a common golbal form (international forms of english)
      - interesting case of delibert divergent = people do it delibertly (london = cockney rhyming slang), criminal activity in London
        - A + B = C, B rhymes with C = they want to communicate the meaning of C without say it
        - apples and pears = pears rhymes with stairs
        - brown bread = dead
        - speaker of it will make it more difficult
          - B part rhythems with your intend words
          - A + B --> B apple and pears --> apples
          - AB --> B brown bread --> brown
            - it's very wide spread, if you visit you may hear people say things sound werid
          - use your loaf, mate --> bread  --> head = use your head
          - I'll have a butcher's for it --> hook --> look = I'll have a look for it
          - where's your dog --> bone --> phone = where's your phone
- global attitudes to English
  - british colonium dominatiion
    - english got retained, becuase it's useful eventhough they have a nagetive attitude towards it
    - seems to be a global language
    - at the same time, the local forms of english is highly valueable
    - india = english is localized in indian language
    - west afarica as well = english is a language of their own country
    - these countries usually do not have localized forms yet, and becuase of it english does not project national identity, we do find people the use of english with their own personal identity
    - my personality chages from japanese mode to english mode = language with perception
  - creative use of english by second lanbguage speakers = people are speaking it confidently and fluently, new works of liteature
    - how does these writers feel writing in their L2
