  - limited english preforency
  - 43% of total number of children in the country have limited English profiency
    - what can we do about it?

Kinds of informaiton to include 
- where the members of this group live?
- is there is an area of LA country where a large populaiton of this group live?
- provide figures and distribution of the group where possible

AAVE (african American Vernacular English)
- grammar = omission of verb be
- standard english: she _ real skinny
- be is omited in the present tense
- AAVW only allows be to be omitted in the same placed that SAE allows be to be contrasted

Be contraction 
- she is really nice --> she's really nice
- you are the boss --> you're the boss
- no contraction is allowed at the ends of sentences
- enviroment of speakers of AAVE allows be omission
  - govern be contrastion

similarities between SAE and AAVE
- when SAE allows be contraction, AAVE allows be omission

invariant be 
- use of be with I you he etc
- Lou usually be here around 9
- sometime he be sleeping all day
- origin?
- like SW British 'be'? --> south west england --> do we assume that? no we do not assume that --> there are semantic restrictions 
  - I be in the garden right now

when do they use it?
- AAVE invariant be is only used for
  - actions which are habits = repeated
  - long-lasting situations/states
- not used for short-lasting states
- she be busy right now instead she _ busy right now

Different types of Aspect
- tense markers like 'will' and '-ed' indicate when an event occurs - in the past, present or future
- aspect markers emphasize the way that an event occurs in different ways
  - habitual aspect = for repeated actions = used to, he used to read novels = invariant be
  - progressive aspect = ongoing actions = to be or ing, on-going for a period of time
  - completive aspect = emphasizes the compleiton of an event = the even is over = done
  - remote aspect = emphasizes that an event took place quiet a long time ago = been
    - AAVE is much rich in these categories
    - continuative aspect = steady

The origins of AAVE?
- certain special characteristics of AAVE
  - Southern US English
  - British English
  - Pidgins and Creoles
- what are the origins of AAVE?
- Two theories:
  - English Origins hypothesis
    - Anganles hypotehsis: slave from west african acquired english through interactions with slave trader, to observe features of regional English
    - hearing southern US English adding special sothern features 
  - the creolist hypothesis
    - developped corele languages then slaves moved to USA, then continuou to speak them than passed to later generation of slaves
    - increased contact through de-creolizaiton changed the creole and made it more like standarded english 

Ebonic controversy 
- oakland school board
  - a declaration intended to address language chanllages ezperiencer by AAVE
  - ebonics derives from African languages and it is not a variety of English = arrived in African language
- fiancial = recognized as a seperat language, if ebonic is a seperate langauge, schools with AA students would qualify for government support of bilingual educaiton
  - no ebonics is not a different language, it's a dialect of english
  - no bilingual educaiton support is justified
    - different languages may have special support, but dialects do not qualify for the same resources
- social consequences
  - AA community = AAVE is not a seperate language, should not be used to teach in the classroom
  - AA students would be tacght in AAVE annd fail to acquire standard english
  - until recent times = a range of postive progress in the 21st century = bidilaeclism
    - treat SAE and AAVE as two equal dialects, appropriate for use in different domains of life
    - SAE for teaching
    - AAVE for family and friends
    - both dialects presented as having value
  - teach skills of code-switching between home varity and standardized english
  - constrastive analysis = grammar and pronounciaiton
  - learn how to translate between SAE and AAVE

Postivie new approaches 
- promotion of bi-dialectlism, code-switching and the use of constrastive analysis are procing highly effective
- improved acqusiting of standardized english
- similar to the same suiation for different countries
  - active bidialectlism = standard language in school for formal communicaiton
