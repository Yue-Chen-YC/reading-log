## Week 3
- Nepal
  - very mixed population
  - many groups, languahes
  - multilingualism

 - Strong rejection of monolingual nationalism
  - massive resurgence of pride in ethno-linguistic diversity
  - thought the repression of other languages and cultures was sucessful
  - people demand for lingusitics pluralism
  - like taiwan = forced people, people don't like be forced to do things, forcing them to think about their home languages

- The ainu group in Japan
  - they look different, they dressed in different way
  - their language is different compared to japanese
  - cultural contact with people in Japan
  - the differences between the ainu and the japanese people were originally viewed positively
  - press impossed on ainu people
  - acitve dissimilation = they want the ainu people to main the differences
  - changed in 18th century
  - russian infleucnes = caused a reaction of worry, the japanese decided that they need to steagth their border and make them into japanese people
  - now you must learn japanese and dressed like japnaese = active assimilation = into japanese people lingusiticly and culturaly
  - the threat recedes
  - stoped assimilation policy and tell the ainu people to be different
  - mordernization = japan was a nation with single culture with a single ethnic and single language
  - pressure on the ainu people and give up speaking their heritage language
  - effects: ainu has almost disappeared = a dying language

frist assignment --> need to download it from the brightspace!

  Language under pressure

language maintenance, shift and loss
- immigrant minorities
  - language group 1 --> language group 2
- indigenous minorities
  - no movement of speakers of language group 1
  - expansion of the territory of lanaguage group 2/LG2 to absorb LG1
  - exmaple: native american groups in the USA, ethnic minorities in China, and Ainu in Jpan
- border-change minorities
  - the borders of two states change as the reuslt of international conflict
  - one portion of the territory of LG 1 is taken by LG 2
  - exmaple: Texas becomes part of the USA, South Tirol becomes part of Italy
 
  Three generation pattern of language shift and loss
  - common language shift from Heritage Language to the local majority language acorss three genration
  - Example: Hmong immigrants from Laos settling in Fresno, CA
 
which generation do speakers belong to?
- generation 2 = you and your family live in the US, parents bron outside of the USA, your parents first language is not English
- generation 3 = you and your family live in the US, parents bron inside of USA, grandparents bron outside of US, your ggrapntoarnets first language is not english
- generation 1 = your are citizen or permanent resident, born in the USA, your first language is English

Complex suiations also arise 
- genration 1.5
- she's gerantion 1 chinese-american, becuase she's fully fluent in English and all her teenage years in the US
- but she's not exactly gernation 2 Chinese American
- two culture and two languages
- between gerantion 1 and gerantion 2

Linguistics input and language outcome? maybe a little lecture? --> later units 

what causes people not to use or learn their heritage languages? 
- speed-up language loss
  - political factors
  - exmaple: japanese goverment
  - social pressures = not use the heritage language = stagmized
  - economic factors = which to using other languages in order to get better employment
  - social status = sociated with higher social prestiage, higher social and sucessful
  - inter-marriage = father and mother are different speakers of languages, language transmission
  - the infleucne of school = children spend all day using the language with other children and teachers in school
  - children's lack of motivation to learn/use the HL

factors slow down language loss
- large concertration of minority/hl groups
- the arrival of new, monolingual immigrants = practice and use their language, news, medias, radios
- isolated communcition (country side) = in a small community, these communities maintain their language well
- visits to the home country = able to use the heritage language and
- parents committed to te transmission of HLs to their children = needs to learn culutre background
- opportunities to learn the HL in the school = dual language progrma, weekend school

The generation 4 effect 
- increaseing properity/eceonimc stability -> desire to reconnect with heritage background

- capacity
- opportunity
- desire
  - all needed for maintain sucess
 
COD and Mirpur Pahari in the UK
- 75% of people from Pakistan living in the UK come from the Mirpur area
- Capacity = MP is learned well, mothers teach their children MP
- Opportunity = speakers can use MP in the local area + on regular trips to Pakistan
- Desire = strongly positive attitude to MP, even younger people use it to each other
- 

COD and Hindi in the USA
- South Asians are the fastest-growing minority group in the USA, second after Mexican-Americans
- token populaiton in 2001, grow really fast in recent years over 2 million
- offer visas for highly-skilled applicants
- Hindi-HL group: a quarter of the 2 million population
- heavily concentrated in CA + four other states
- despit of the large number but poot transmission of Hindi to G2 and G3

COD and Hindi
- Capacity is an issue = don't help children to learn Hindi, atypical generation one speakers, they are bilinguals already, English and Hindi, English is the dominant language at home
- opportunity- not fullfilled well, hindi is not used as a common language, English tends to be the common language, hindi is not widly used
- desier - attitudes to Hindi are positive, fullfilled well
- without the capactiy and opportunity, we can not pass the language, all three is important

Language endangerment and language death
- language death = compelete dispear of a language
- endangered language = when smaller language is under pressure and dispearing (life style)

language endangermened 
- size of the community and be careful about patterns of decline
- if language has many speakers, it must be safe
- rates of decline, languages can go into decline very quickly
- breton (France): 1.5 milltion speakers = large language
- after 100 years, this populaiton dropped to 200,000 speakers
- still seems a lot, but if the rate of decline continues, Breton will die out this century

Moribund
- they are not successfully transmitted to younger generations
- if one goes into the minority language community, you should pay attention to the age of the speakers
- very few new speakers
- age agianst number of tribal language
- a huge proportion of tribal language for 80 years old

large languages and small languages 
- there are 6000 - 70000 languages in the world
- majority of the world's 7 billion populaiton speak one of a very few languages as their L1
  - they are 8 language with 100+ million L1 speakers
  - These account for 3 billion of the world’s population
    - English, Spanish, Mandarin

- 96% of the world’s languages are spoken by only 4% of the world’s population.

Where is language endangerment most severe?
- Language endangerment and language death have been most serious in the Americas and Australia.
- less serious in Africa and Asia
- language endangerment is affecting as a goal thing

Reasons to be concerned about the loss of the world’s languages
- the language of every group is an expression of its cultural identity and individual identity
  - heritage language is important for self confidence and individual identities
- Language death is leading to a massive loss of global cultural diversity.
  - culture diveristy is beneficial
- Different languages may be able to tell us a lot about the world
  - knowledge embodied about this languages
  - diverse local plant-life, medicines

Causes of language endangermen
- economic factors: people switch to speaking other languages to get work + decide not to transmit their  HLs to their children to help maximize their chances of success.
- Social factors: larger languages are considered prestigious, smaller languages inferior – by larger groups, so minorities develop negative attitudes to their own languages. Felt to be a hindrance to social and economic progress.
- The growth of larger languages – causes smaller languages to be used in fewer domains of life.
- Globalization. The increase in interna􀆟onal travel → more need for lingua francas → pressure on smaller
languages.
- Urbanization. People leave smaller communities to live in larger towns and cities, where they can no longer use their HL.
- Invasion and colonization. The movement of outsiders into areas inhabited by smaller groups → creation of minorities.
- Physical causes. Disease, crop-failure and famine, earthquakes, tsunamis.

The Oroqen in NW China
- lifestyle changed in 1950s in a positive way
- improved the living conditions of minority groups
- better educaiton, health health
- han chinese settler come into the oroqen area and inter marriage, with special privileges
  - better housing, no one-child-per-family restriction
- causes language shift and loss of Oroqen

Positive reactions to language endangerment
Two major initiatives:
- Language documentation
  - describe a record of these languages by asking speakers of this language
- Language revitalization
  - helping communities to regain these languages and teach young children with their heritage language

Organizations all over the world are now helping EL communities to stabilize their HLs.

Language Documentation
- goal: get good records of these languages spoken
- lingusitics trained in skills at unfamilar languages and create dictionraries and grammatical descriptions of ELS

Language Revitalization
- knwoeldge gained from the documentation
  - used as teaching
  - educaiton
  - immersion teaching
  - bilingual educaiotn program
  - in new zeland = pre-school language nests = elders from the community come and speaker the el WITH YOUNG CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE DAY
  - Master-apprentice language-learning programs
    - a native speaker master works with an apprentice 10-20 hours per week using only the EL


   The revitalization of Hebrew
  - major community effort the revitalize Hebrew

Maori, New Zealand
- spoken by everyone in New Zealand before the arrival of the British in 19thC
- enforced English-only in schoold, using Maori resulted in punishments
- post WWII urbanization --> pressure on Maori-english needed to get jobs
- Maori was expected to die out
- 1980s, a new revival movement
- maori as the offical language of the country
- tv program in Maori, and Maori Language Commission
- new pride of Maori culture
- in a very positive way of Maori culture
