## Week 5

Unit 4

## Code-switching 
- different ways and different levels of code-switching

How can you distinguish code-switching and broworing? 
- heard a word in a sentence
  - is it borrowing or code-switching
  - all language have borrowed words, but not everyone need to do code-swiching
  - do not require people to be bilingual
- pay attention to the words is pronoucned = borowwing = change the pronounciaiton adjustment, sound in the other language is pronouncied in a certain way
- mum seoi = monsoon cantonese - english
- bok-king = pekin
- strike = sutoraki engligh - japanese
- I pronounced it in a English-pronounced way = browing
- tomorrow i'm going to hongkong = if hongkong is pronounced in cantonese way, it is a cs

models of code-swiching 
- insertional CS
  - words from L2 are inserted into the L1 base
  - your second language is not actied in the same way, as you produce the sentence in L2
  - activate in spanish without fully acited in englush
  - good model for lower level of code-switching
 
- alternational cs
  - it's difficult to identify any base language both l2 and l2 appear in equal amounts
  - two-base languages actived and they swich into each othe r
  - good analysis of level 3 and level 4 CS
 
what causes people to CS?
- three major factors
  - imbalance in the knwoeldge of L1 and L2
  - stylistic reasons
  - identity-realted reasons

fully balanced bilinguals = two languages are same knwoeldge 
- imbalance of knwoledge = family realted stuff, emotions for one language, and educaiton vocabulty for second language
- most of people are not fully balanced bilinguals
- many people learned language in sequce = sequancial bilinguals
- parents with different languagehs = cemotenriness bilinguals
- stylistic reasons for CS
  - speakers often say that they CS for fun, to vary the style of their speech
  - CS if often felt to give speech a younger, more interesting falvor
  - similar to stylistic variety used in texting and messaging, using abbreviations, symbols and emotions
  - cs is often done to stress solidarity which is closeness with other by using a distinctive form of speech together
  - identity-related reasongs
    - connection with others to reduced the distance, convergence or accomidaiton = a change of our  behavior, make it closer to the people that we interact with, you change the way of you speak and make people feel closer
    - ottowa and hull are adjacent communities in cannada
   
divergence 
- the opposite of lingustic accommodation and convergence
- linguistics divergence = inter-generational communication
  - each generation has its own preferred or dominant language
  - parents and grandparents prefer to use the heritage language, none of the side is acommdating others
