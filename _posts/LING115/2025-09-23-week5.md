## Week 5

Unit 4

## Code-switching 
- different ways and different levels of code-switching

How can you distinguish code-switching and broworing? 
- heard a word in a sentence
  - is it borrowing or code-switching
  - all language have borrowed words, but not everyone need to do code-swiching
  - do not require people to be bilingual
- pay attention to the words is pronoucned = borowwing = change the pronounciaiton adjustment, sound in the other language is pronouncied in a certain way
- mum seoi = monsoon cantonese - english
- bok-king = pekin
- strike = sutoraki engligh - japanese
- I pronounced it in a English-pronounced way = browing
- tomorrow i'm going to hongkong = if hongkong is pronounced in cantonese way, it is a cs

models of code-swiching 
- insertional CS
  - words from L2 are inserted into the L1 base
  - your second language is not actied in the same way, as you produce the sentence in L2
  - activate in spanish without fully acited in englush
  - good model for lower level of code-switching
 
- alternational cs
  - it's difficult to identify any base language both l2 and l2 appear in equal amounts
  - two-base languages actived and they swich into each othe r
  - good analysis of level 3 and level 4 CS
 
what causes people to CS?
- three major factors
  - imbalance in the knwoeldge of L1 and L2
  - stylistic reasons
  - identity-realted reasons

fully balanced bilinguals = two languages are same knwoeldge 
- imbalance of knwoledge = family realted stuff, emotions for one language, and educaiton vocabulty for second language
- most of people are not fully balanced bilinguals
- many people learned language in sequce = sequancial bilinguals
- parents with different languagehs = cemotenriness bilinguals
- stylistic reasons for CS
  - speakers often say that they CS for fun, to vary the style of their speech
  - CS if often felt to give speech a younger, more interesting falvor
  - similar to stylistic variety used in texting and messaging, using abbreviations, symbols and emotions
  - cs is often done to stress solidarity which is closeness with other by using a distinctive form of speech together
  - identity-related reasongs
    - connection with others to reduced the distance, convergence or accomidaiton = a change of our  behavior, make it closer to the people that we interact with, you change the way of you speak and make people feel closer
    - ottowa and hull are adjacent communities in cannada
   
divergence 
- the opposite of lingustic accommodation and convergence
- linguistics divergence = inter-generational communication
  - each generation has its own preferred or dominant language
  - parents and grandparents prefer to use the heritage language, none of the side is acommdating others
 
Attitudes to CS
- attitudes held toward CS may vary

can attitudes to CS be predicted?
- size of the population where CS occurs
- speakers' abilities in L1 and L2, or they confident or not, when they know the two languages well, they tend to be more positive, if they are not strong in their L2, they are more worries 
- speakers' age: younger speaker tend to be more positive about code-switching

## Unit 5: Pidgins and Creoles
- mixed languages: using many words from existing languages
- pidgins = based on english
- mixed languages based on words, quiet mutally intelligenable, based on English and French
- in multilingual situations
- disglossia = used of two languages in special way

## development of new languages 
- mixtures, a range of different languages
- stages of pidgins and creoles life cycle

## the birth of Pidgin languages 
- pidgins often arise when two conditions are met
  - speakers of more than 2 languages need to communicate and have no shared language
  - there is an imbalance in the power relations of the language groups
  - imbalance of power, one groupd ominants another grousp
  - work force of labours
  - power imbalance there's a limited contact
 
## results 
- new pigion
  - takes words from the dominant group
  - very little grammar in the early pigion
  - workers have one on one communication, you have very little oppunities to learn a language
  - they are restricted on their usage = little vocabulary and grammar
  - use in work place, but not outside of the work place
    - superstrate language = dominant language = lexifier language
    - substrate language = worker

## Hawaiian Pidgin English
- from japan, china, portugual, pillions

- They need to communicate together
- english is the superstrate language
- worker use the words in the planatation

## 4 kinds of contact situations 
- workplace pidgions = laborers from different language backgrounds
- working on plantations as migrant laboreres and in mines
  - Hawaiian Pidgin
  - Fanakolo mining community
- communities of slaves
- trading pidgins
  - traders interact with groups speaking different/other languages
    - Chinook Jargon
    - Bazaar Malay (fundation for indunisia)
    - Chinese pidgin Russian (Chinese traders in Russia)
- Maritime pidgins
  - crews working on ships from different language backgrouns
    - Sabir (Mediterranean)
- Wartime/occupation pidgins
  - foreign soliders interacting with local people
 
Golabl distribution of pidgins/creoles 
- coastal areas

Pidgins superstrates
- English, french, spanish, protugese, dutch
- send ships to trade around, powerful countries
- pidgins with non-European lexifiers
  - Nubi, Arabic, East Africa
 
## life cycle of pidgins and creoles 
1. early pidgin = L2 language, very basic language, simply the grammar, pronouncations
2. stablized pidgin = L2 language, regularization of word order, stablization of vocabulary
3. expanded pidgin (not in all community) = L2, more complexity
4. pidgins --> creoles = a creole is pidgin of native speakers, new language with L1 speakers, more complicated, rapid expansion of grammar, vocabulary and domains of use

## stage 1 early pidgin
- very basic communciaiton, very little grammar involved
- very variable word order
- what they produced is very ambiguious
- very restricted in what can be communicated = work realted information, no social interactions

## substrate speakers 
- elimination of functionla words
- pigion speaker will produce the superstrate
- leave out auxiliary, determiners, complementizers
  - the doctor is a good man
  - doctor good man
- simplificaiton of superstrate morphology
  - simply the word strcuture
  - walked --> walk
- reduction of superstrate vocabulary size (small)
  - early pidgin vocabulary: 200 - 300 words
  - superstrate English vocabulary
    - 50,000 words = college students know
- Reanalysis of words
  - words from the superstrate are given new meanings
    - belong --> bilong = of, belonging to
- adjustment of the pronounciaiton of wrods borrowed from the superstrate: phonology sounds
  - the sound strcuture does not match
  - english vowels = 14
  - pidgin = 5-7 vowel
  - convergence: if the same sounds occur in both the superstrate and the substrates --> substrate speakers retain these in the pidgin, the pidgin sound system converges on sounds common in both sperstrate and substrate
  - leveeling = getting rid of sounds which aren't shared
 
## Examples of levelling and convergence 
- some sounds frequently used in English are actually not very common in other languages, and so get adjusted/replaced in early pidgins lexified by English
  - th adjusted to d, this = dis
  - th adjusted to t, thing = ting
  - sh adjusted to s, ship = sip
  - f adjusted to p, fellow = pela
- consonante group clusters do not occur in many languages
  - nd adjusted to n, hand = han
 
- word order
  - superstrate word order is fixed and helps speakers understand the meaning of sentences
    - early pidgin word order is chaotic and not fixed
    - sara cooked yams = sara cook yam or yam cook sara

## stage 2: stabilized pidgins 
- word order stabilization
  - speaker establish regular ways of ordering subjects, objects and verbs
  - reduces ambiguity and increases efficiency in communicaiton in the pidgin
- vocabulary growth
  - allows the pidgin to be used in an increased set of domians, to talk about a wider range of topics
  - the vocabulary is increased in a variety of ways
- polysemy
  - a word can be used more than 1 meaning
  - mole = animail or spy
  - a crane = a bird, a piece of lifting equipment
- multi-functionality = different grammatical functions
  - bad = adjective, noun, adverb, verb
- further reanalysis of superstrate words
  - chinese pidgin english
  - before = past time marker/tense
  - before me sell um for ten dollar
- compound words
  - novel combinations of two existing words to create a word with a new meaning
  - green house, wet suit, hard drive
    

## Creolization
- when a pidgin becomes the L1/mother tongue of speakers = creole
- Creoles are used in all domains of life
- Its grammar becomes more complex, and the vocabulary increases considerably
- new grammatical words appear, grammatical markers (past tense marker)
- future tense marker has been created, people can talk about future events
- determiners such as the and a careated and being complex
- complexity in grammar
- people change the pronounciation, becuase they are confordent first language speakers


## future events 
- by and by
- baimibai mi go
- young children take the input form their parents are taking them and reduce them
- children developing creoles create all kinds of sophisticated grammatical elelmetns
- creoes diverge more and more from the superstrates they are realted to, they are mutually unintelligable

## further questions and themes
- theories of why pidgins and creoles around the world seem to be very similar in many ways
- life cycle of pidgin and creole
- movie on pidgins/creoles in new guinea

## Theories of the global similarity of pidgins and creoles
- pidgins and creoles all over the world have been noticed to be very similar in their grammar and kinds of functional words which develop
- children somehow can take pigion languages how are they able to do this?
- pidgins and creoles all over the world often have some protuguese words in them, what explains this?

## A single-origin theory of pidgins
- pidgins created for european lanbguages, they are very similar to each other, they come from a single source such as sabir, trading and ships, middle age
- pidgin created with portruguese words
- relexification: linguistics process, 2 languages, a and b, and then speakers start to use the words from language a to language b, without changing the grammar of language a
- china: urgua, they start to speak a variety of urgua, such as urgue grammar with chinese wrods using the urgua grammar
- saramaccan pidgin, spoken in suriname
- single invidual chirstopher taylor = language savant
- Christopher was just relexifying English with words from these other languages – e.g. Hindi words with English grammar, Russian words with English grammar = relexify english again and again

## single-origin
- repeated again and again, trading pigions
- similarity retained, and they become relexified

## hypothesis 2 = acqusition approach 
- universal grammar
- timing is important = critical period
- children are faster and at certain age they become more difficult to learn languages

## Back to pidgins and creoles 
- UG is taken to be used by adults to creat pidgin languages and by children to develop pidgins into much more complex creoles

## single orgion and language acquistion hypothesis 
- similarity maintained --> does not say about the simple --> complex form, explain the frequent presence of portugese words 
- acqusiton: similarity between pigion and creola based on the same brain strucutre, simple form --> complex from, doesn't explain the frequent presence of portugese words
- most mordern linguist will support language acquistion hypotehsis

## a pidgin and creole sign language 
- what happened outside of the classroom, young students were communicating with each other, and they are succesfully with each other
- siged pigion
- younger kids developped a much more complex signs with grammar
