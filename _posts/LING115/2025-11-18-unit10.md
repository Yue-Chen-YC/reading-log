## bilinguals and the LRH
- how you preceive or think of the world
- what if you are bilinguals?
-   consective bilingual, L1 remains dominant even when an L2 is acquired
-   bilinguals = 2 different modes in perception, if you speak chinese, your motor perception is sturcutred in Chinese, you may alternate based on your use of languages
-   a hybid motor perception from L1/L2 develops which is not like the MOP of monolinguals L1 or L2 speakers

autobiographical memory 
- how we remember things that have happened to us in the past
- Studies show that our memory of past events is coded for the language spoken during the event 

## Language and Gender

## The big question 
- why do these differences consistently seem to be found?
- these generalizations about M/F speech differences are widespread but do not apply to all sections of society


## 2 theories
- Peter Trudgill
  - solidarity causes men and women to speak the same
    - female speakers avoid forms which are considered lowe-status
      - non-standard or incorrect forms
    - female speakers favor forms which are considered prestigious and of higher status
    - social pressures are uneven for men and women in the soceity
    - 4 different kinds of social pressure
      - social status: standard speech forms are associated with higher education and social status
      - women's expected function as role models of correct behavior compared to men in society
        - expects better behavior from women than from men
      - differences in power between men and women
        - power imbalance between men and women
        - male dominate society = women will speak more carefully and more standard language 
     - masculinity is communicated by non-standard speech
       - if women do not want to be regarded as masculine/tough, they may aim to avoid non-standard forms of speech
    - different pressures on male speech
      - lower working class = pressure to project a masculine image and show solidarity with other from your own background
