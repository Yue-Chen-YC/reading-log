## Things I learned 
- ## Chapter One
- Classifiers such as zhi are called individual classifiers, and di is called an individuating classifier (CLs) (Chao, 1968).
- Language with both types of CLs, such as Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and Mayan languages are called numeral CL languages.
- Traditional binary count-mass division is not fine-grained enough to reach an acceptable level of descriptive adequacy.
  - Classifier-noun dependency is not binary
  - Identify two new properties
    - features
- Mandarin Chinese has a systemic way to encode the contrast
  - reduplicative of CL (片片 叶子 vs. 片 叶子)
- CLs in CL languages may play multiple roles
  - numeral expression
  - selectional restractions on the nouns
- ## Chapter Tow：Classifiers and countability
- 2 syntagmatic properties of nominals are syntactically significant
  - The ability of a noun to combine with a numeral directly (numerability)
  - the ability of a noun to be modified by a delimitive (size, shape or boundary) modifier (delimitability)
- Can be attested in the co-occurrence restrictions of
  - articles
  - quantifiers
  - adverbs
  - and CLs
    - in pronominalization
    - in certain context-triggered shifts
2 kinds of relationship between linguistic elements
- paradigmatic : substitution test (of, by, for), one of them can substitute another, each of them may occur in the same syntactic position
  - gender, person of nominal expression
- syntagmatic: compatibility of co-occurring elements in the same construction (e.g., relationship between the and people)
  - selection features
  - drink c-select a nominal, becuase it needs to occur with a nominal
  - s-selects a liquid-denoting nominal, becuase it needs to combine with this type of nominal
 
Grabability of adjectival expressions is defined by the possibility to occur with relative degree word such as quite, terribly and fairly. 

Feature delimitability
- some words may be modified by a size-denoting expression (e.g., big small), shape-denoting expression (e.g., long, round, square, thin), or boundary expression (e.g., whole).
- delimitability is syntagmatically, but it has a semantic correaltion
  - when a nominal has [+ Delimitable] feature, its denotation must have a certain shape ot precise limits
  - the shape or limits are delimitable in certain dimensions (e.g., length, size, volume, shape and time).
  - a nominal with [- Delimitable] features, denotes either material, which is in itself indepednt of shape or size, such as silver, water or immaterial notions that have no intrinsic boundaries, such as leisure, music, traffic.
