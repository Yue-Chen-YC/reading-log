The Gestural Structure of Speech

Phonetic theory
- a theory of structure of the human speech system = what the parts, how they work together 
  - how they function in communication = structures that regulate, the listeners are aware of these structures, the speech system is part of communication 
  - how it is cognitively represented and its role in the grammar = how speech system is represented in movement
  - theory of cogntive and physical sctrucutre of speech
- Satisfying these aims require characterizing:
• the continuous properties of speech articulation, acoustics, aerodynamics (air flow in the vocal tract), audition, etc. = continuous and discrete = how to characterize, fouries analysis, speech signal change over time
• AND their communicative, informational and cognitive properties 
• This leads to a classic theoretical problem.

Apparently incompatible of different descriptions of speech
- phonology = must be true if it's a discrete symbol = traditional phonological represention of utterances, sequances of discrete symbols
- phsycial properities
  - continous, context-dependent varation, but the symbols are not context-dependent
 
Problem how to related phonology and phsycial measturments

- incompatibility

Articulatory Phonology (Browman & Goldstein, 1989): Key components of resolution
- Articulatory Synergy representation

Information and the dance
- All the information in our messages (thoughts, ideas, etc.) of arbitrary complexity must ultimately be associated with unique simple dances.
- • What are the discrete units of the dance??
  - underly hypothesis = decomposed to actions (dancesteps)
- A gesture is defined as
  - a constriction action of one of the distinct vocal tract organs. = causeing the vocal track to be narrow
  - closure gesture = upper and lower lip all come together

- window = create discrete units

words and contrast 
- Words (or, morphemes) are elements of a language that have distinct meanings and which are also associated (arbitrarily) with distinct "dances" of the vocal tract organs.
- differences between and across individual speakers
- how do individuals perforam the same gestures differently?
  - motor task = skill of motor actions, involves corporation of articulators (more than one articulatiors)
  - redundancy = if you use it properly same task, it needs to be preformed in the same way
  - we learned to perform a task, pattern of dependency among the articulators specific to teh task
  - synergy / corridnative strucutre

Speech Tasks: Constriction Goals and Synergies

Function of Synergies in Speech
• Different people learn to tune the synergy differently: They employ different relative contributions of these articulators.
• Relative contributions differ when some perturbing event occur in the world.
• Relative contributions differ when the task is produced in the context of other tasks.
- children learning stragties for something too big or small for their hard strucutre

Speaker differences in Lip Closure synergies
- lip closure in back and been
- consontant + vowels start at the same point of time
- jaw is lower in the context of low vowel, and high for high vowel
- more upper lip lowering emerges in back than in been

coarticulation = change with vowels 

The Listener’s Task
- Listener must be able to tell what actions are being performed in a talker’s mouth, even they are hidden from sight
- Speech as audible gesture = think about gestures like sign languages
- gestures in signs that communicated optically to the visual system of the receiver
- perception = give information about the envitorment, production are communciated acousticsly to the auditoary system, the speech sounds you can hear the purely sound, certain gestures do not have any sounds, but /s/ has a sound, perception of sound, then you have the ability to hear the differences
- sound has multiple representations
- the auditory properties of sound can be coded differently
- we can hear the talker's producing is our perception system is able to extract information from the eviroment
- voices involve the musale movement
- geastures = are simple constractions, gestures for different sounds, may have different auditory outcomes
- gestures can have goals that is not articulatory
