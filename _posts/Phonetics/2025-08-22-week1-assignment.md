differences between consonants and vowels
- Consonants involve some constriction of airflow
- vowels do not
- voicing = what the vocal folds are doing 
- place of articulation = where the constriction of airflow takes place
  - bilabial [p] [b] [m] = both lips come together
  - labiodental [f] [v] = upper teeth and lower lip
  - interdental [θ] = tongue in between upper and lower teeth
  - alveolar [t] [d] [s] = upper front teeth and tongue
  - palatal [ʃ] [j] = hard palate or roof of the mouth
  - velar [k] = at velum or soft palate
  - glottal [h] = at glottis or the space between the vocal folds
- manner of articulation

p = bilabial voiceless plosive
t = alveolar voiceless plosive
k = velar voiceless plosive
b = bilabial voiced plosive
m = bilabial voiced nasal
n = alveolar voiced nasal
ŋ = velar voiced nasal
f = labiodental voiceless fricative
θ = dental voiceless fricative
s = alveolar voiceless fricative
ʃ = postalveolar voiceless fricative
w = labial–velar Voiced approximant
l = post-avelaor voiced lateral approximant
r = alveolar retrofix
j = palatal voiced approximant
h = glottal voiceless fricative


1 = b = bilabial voiced (vocal fold narrow, lips come together, velar?velum not lower)
2 = k (voiceless velar)
3 = ŋ (voiced velar, nasal?)
4 = t (alveolar, voiceless, not nasal, not sure if it's s or ʃ or t) = wrong = ʃ
5 = f (voiceless, labio?)
6 = l (voiced, similar to retroflex? aveloar)
7 = p (bilabiol, voiceless)
8 = ʃ (voiceless, aveolar, not sure if it's s or ʃ or t) = wrong = t
9 = h (voiceless, nothing moved, similar to h mri)
10 = m (bilabial, nasal)
11 = r (retroflex)
12 = θ (labialdental? voiceless)
13 = j (palatal, voiced)
14 = n (nasal, alveolar)
15 = s (alveolar, voiceless, compared to 8, very similar?  not sure if it's s or ʃ or t)
16 = w (labial–velar, voiced)

ask about 4, 15 and 8, all seems very similar to me
- alveolar stop is hitting the edger of the root, alveolar rige is back
- fricatives = tongue is making a major part of the palatal so it's narrower
- θ is dental, is right behind the lower teeth
- s, tip of the tongue is hitting the tongue
