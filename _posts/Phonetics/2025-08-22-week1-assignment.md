differences between consonants and vowels
- Consonants involve some constriction of airflow
- vowels do not
- voicing = what the vocal folds are doing 
- place of articulation = where the constriction of airflow takes place
  - bilabial [p] [b] [m] = both lips come together
  - labiodental [f] [v] = upper teeth and lower lip
  - interdental [θ] = tongue in between upper and lower teeth
  - alveolar [t] [d] [s] = upper front teeth and tongue
  - palatal [ʃ] [j] = hard palate or roof of the mouth
  - velar [k] = at velum or soft palate
  - glottal [h] = at glottis or the space between the vocal folds
- manner of articulation
