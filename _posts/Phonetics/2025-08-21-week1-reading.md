## My thoughts

## Theoretical goals 
1. develop a realistic understanding og language forms as language users know them, produce them, and perceive them
2. Aim to understand how the forms might have emerged in the evolutionary history of humans and how they arise developmentally, as a child interacts with speakers in the environment

## Concepts 
# - Language forms (public actions)
  - entities of various grain sizes that theories of phonology characterize, which means languages provide to make between-person linguistic communication possible, not the mental categories of most theories of phonology, production, and perception
 
# - A theory of phonology
  - Theory about the properties of those public actions
 
# - A theory of speech production
  - How those actions are achieved

# - A theory of speech perception
  - How those actions are perceived
 
# - A theory of the emergence of phonological structure in language
  - How particulate language forms emerged in the course of communicative exchanges between people
  - predicts the forms will have properties that adapt them for public language use
    - for speaking
    - for perception
    - from acoustic speech signals

# Articulatory phonology
1.  Phonology as a combinatoric system
- ## Speech is a continuous, context-dependent motion of a large number of degrees of freedom; the actions themselves that engage the vocal tract and regulate the motions of its articulators are discrete and context-independent
- ## phonological units are abstract in being coarse-grained (low-dimensional) with specific motions of articulators, and to the acoustic structure that may specify the motions 
  - Most fundamental property of speech communication -> phonological structure
    - small (<100) inventory of primitive units to combine in different ways -> form words (vocabularies of human languages)
    - combinatoric property -> chemical compounding and genetic recombination
   
  - self-diversifying systems
    - atomic units are distinct from one another
    - retain discreteness when they combine to form new objects
    - The diversity of combinations tends to decrease as more and more atoms join
    - toward the mean value of the scalar units
    - ## recurring substructures
    - ## hierarchy
      - show that combination involves: creation of new objects when atoms retain their discrete identities
    - segments = phonological units

2.  Units of combination (atoms) are constriction actions of vocal organs
- phonological units have dual roles
  1. units of action
  2. units of combination (and contrast)
## Three key hypotheses 
1. The vocal tract activity can be analyzed into constriction actions of distinct vocal organs
2. Actions are organized into temporally overlapping structures
3. Constriction formation is appropriately modeled by dynamical systems

2.2.1.  Constriction actions and the organs that produce them

## 6 distinct organs 
- lips
- tongue tip
- tongue body
- tongue root
- velum
- larynx

- gestures = constricting actions of distinct organs
  - atoms of a combinatoric system = satisfy the property of discrete differences
- 2 combinations of geatures
  - can be defined as potentially contrasting with one another
  - if : include at least one distinct constriction geatures
  - example: pack vs. tack (pack includes a lips geature, taks includes a tongue tip geature)

2.2.2.  Coordination of gestures and overlap
Articulatory phonology hypotehsiszes 
- geatures are coordinated into more elaborate molecular structures in which geatures can overlap in time
- coproduction = account for superficial context-dependence that is observed in speech

- onsets = ions of a combinatoric system: internally cohesive structures of atoms that recombine readily with other such structures

2.2.3.  Dynamical specification
 - geatural units are dynamical systems

2.3. Evidence for gestures as units of speech production
- speech errors = more direct envidence for decomposing speech prodcution and/or planning into geatural strucutres
- segments are the most common units involved in errors (changes in position, such as anticipations, perseverations and exhanges)

2.4. Phonological knowledge as (abstract) constraints on gestural coordination
- for native speakers' implicit knowledge of phonological structure and regularities in a particular language
  - inventory of lexically contrastive units
  - constraints on phonological forms
  - systematic alternations to lexical forms that result from morphonological combination and embedding in a particular prosodic context
  - phonological generalizations = patterns or modes of coordination
    - two closute geatures will determine the resulting aerodynamic and acoustic consequenese
    - syllable strcutre = disctinct modes of geatura coordination for consonant geatures iin an onset vs. coda
    - Onset = synchronous mode of coordination dominantes
        - consonant geatures
    - coda = sequential mode dominates
      - synchronous prodcution is most compatible with recoverability when a narrow construction (lips, tonegue tip) is coproduced with a wider one (laryngeal or velic geature, voiceless or nasal stops, secondary palatalizaiton, verlarizaiton or rounding)

3. Parity in public language use
- the language forms that the language users know, produce and perceive must be the same

3.1. The need for a common currency in perceptually guided action, including speech
- need for a common currency, the transmitted and received messages may be the same is known as the parity requirment
- perception and action
  - example: imitation by infants, newborns are disposed to imitate the facial geatures of an adult
