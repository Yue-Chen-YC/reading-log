## week 3
- gestures and segments are overlapping over time
- same utteance produced by different speakers and different rates
- not a prosodic boundaries after cooked

TADA
- phonological units (gestures) as Dynamicla systems
- phonological units are the smallest primitives
- they can be modeled as dynamical system
- time and varients
- how long is that unit is active in vocal track and speech sethence
- change is continuous, control the synaergy
- cuase the lips to narrow, shifting to another system
- the system used to define each gestures is context independent
- can have infinite numbers
- when you combine them
- give rise to context-depednet trajectories of the state variable as a function of inital conditions
- where the articulor is at

Task Dynamic Model of Gestures
- gestures can be modeled as a motor task to acheve a goal for a particular state variable
- goal value
- stiffness = how fast
- distinguish state changes and better being control
- prodcution of lip geatures, the upper lip has an equasiton of the jaw
- the task model states have the context independet

Dynamical system for producing lip closure
- actual rule for change in TD
