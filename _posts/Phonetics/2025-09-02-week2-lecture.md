speech gestures are constrictions of tongue tip and tongue body 
- tongue tip and palatal
- speaker differences in lip closure synergies
- achieves a low value of the release 

Introduction to Dynamical Systerms 
- provide potntial solution of one of the problems
- phonolgy units are discrete
- physical measurment is continous

Dynamical system = motion of objects
- used for models with nature phonmonane

what is a dymamical system 
- equation that quantitatively describes the change in something over time or space or both
- 2 parts
  - state of the system = quantity whose change is being described
  - law for how the state changes, depending on the current state, whic predicts the state at the next instant in time = shows the current state predcits
  - useful for modeling something like a unit
  - the dynamical system is constoant, but the law does not useually change, asosoicated with a particiaukar gesture
  - the equation defines it does not change, the state varibale changes
  - the dynamical law changes with time varies or time invaries

Goal or Point Attractor
- the fucntion is different, and the end state is the same
- goal = attracotr = equallium state = all end up in the same state

Rate of Goal Attainment
- stiffness of the system = stress the string and let it go, it will come back faster
- change in x = -k times x

= the change of x depends only on x 
- frist order system and this is linear
- present the value of x against the change of x, we get x as a expendensially decreasing value
- goal is approached at rate determined by k, slow for k near 0, fast for k near 1

First-order system as model of phonological units
- defining phonological units as dynmaicial system
  - laws for fixed values
  - x = phonetic states
  - phonological constonats and time-varying phonetic quantities are in same equation
  - phonetics and phonology does not require any interface
  - equation which includes the phonological primatives and state variables, you can not have one without the other
- a segment is a phonolgical segment, as we see the geasture composed a segment does not really mean they are constrainted at the same time
- tone gestures = syllables and how they are organized, during the interval

- context dependence in real speech
- motion of tongue tip during /d/
  - all trajectories arrived at distance 0
 
Multiple Dynamical Systems
- Possibilities
  - Sequence of two goal values
  - Overlap in time of two systems

Gesture activation time 
- when they are no longer active and govern the behavior of a system only within some fixed epoch of time
- modeling the height of the tongue
  - 0 - 5

Overlap of two systems in time
- most challenging overlap in time
  - two dynamical systems which control the temperature outside and inside the house
    - thermostat
    - chill from outside
- Blending of Overlapping Gestures
   - overlap in time in velar stop and vowels
     - both for the tongue body
     - the vowels and velar stops can't both achieve their tasks, there is no detendency
     - other cases of overlap, such as overlapping sequences of t and k
     - during the overlapping interval, the articulator syneury achieve the goal without overlapping
     - blending the velar stop and the back vowel
     - In English the stop is still the stop, the blending does not affect the degree but the constriction
     - Blending is a property of these gestures in English
     - phobological property of some language
