## Bare classifiers and definiteness A cross-linguistic investigation (Simpson et al., 2011)

## Citation 
Simpson, A., Soh, H. L., & Nomoto, H. (2011). Bare classifiers and definiteness: A cross-linguistic investigation. Studies in Language. International Journal sponsored by the Foundation “Foundations of Language”, 35(1), 168-193.

## My thoughts


## 主要发现
- 虽然 the use of bare classifier patterns for definite reference is a cross-linguistically connected phenomenon, there is more variation between definite bare classifier and bare noun patterns, but preference for one pattern over another needs more functional/pragmatic explanations
- 在这些语言里面，bare classifier有一样的pattern，definiteness也一样
## Bare classifier
- with a noun but without a numeral
- Nominal expression receives a definite interpretation
- classifiers have grammaticalized additional functions linked to the emergence of new definite determiners
- 我想买本书 = indefinite in object position
- 普通话和粤语（越南语，苗语，bangla）的区别
  - 普通话只能在object position
  - 只能有indefinite interpretation in object position
  - 如果要definite interoperation在subject position只能说：狗今天特别累，而不是只狗今天特别累

## Mandarin and Cantonese
- Cheng and Sybesma 1999 found that classifier languages exhibit either the bare classifier or the bare noun pattern for definite reference but not both

## 5 sub-type of situations licensing the use of definite determiners in English 
1. Discourse-anaphoric: A definite determiner is used in reference to an antecedent that is previously introduced by means of some overt linguistic item
  - John has a dog and a cat. The dog is very old
2. Visible and uniquely identifiable for both speaker and hearer
  - Pass me the hammer
3. association/inference, definite identity of a referent results from its association with some other entity mentioned in the discourse
  -  We went to a wedding yesterday. The bride was very beautiful
4. Contextually unique, but not visible
  - Where's the key?
 5. Culturally unique
   - The president has died

## Method
- Focusing on the definite interpretation of bare classifier and bare noun patterns
- three non-Sinitic languages
  - Vietnamese
  - Hmong
  - Bangla
- Two geographical varieties of Cantonese

## Research Questions
- bare classifier 在vietnamese, hmong, bangla, and cantonese 有同样的linguistics pattern吗？Definite interpretations how to define?
- 一种语言中是否有“裸量词”结构，会在多大程度上限制“裸名词”用来表示“特指”含义的可能性？当还有其他方式可以表示“特指”时，哪些因素会影响使用“裸量词”结构还是其他形式来表示“特指”？
