## ClassifierGuesser: A context-based classifier prediction system for Chinese language learners (Peinelt et al., 2017)

## Citation 
Peinelt, N., Liakata, M., & Hsieh, S. K. (2017, November). ClassifierGuesser: A context-based classifier prediction system for chinese language learners. In Proceedings of the IJCNLP 2017, System Demonstrations (pp. 41-44).

## My thoughts
- They mentioned databases with semantic features of Chinese classifiers (Gao, 2011) -> Helena Hong Gao. 2011. E-learning design for
Chinese classifiers: Reclassification. Communications in Computer and Information Science, 177:186–199
  - I need to check it out


## Introduction 
- Languages such as Chinese are characterized by the existence of a class of words commonly referred to as 'classifiers' or 'measure words'. 
- ## Syntax
  - Classifiers are the obligatory component of a quantifier phrase, which is contained in a noun phrase or verb phrase.
- ## Semantics
  - Classifier modifies the quantity or frequency of its head word and requires a certain degree of shared properties between the classifier and the head
- Event classifier: 场
- Context is an important factor for classifier selection, such as 一颗球 vs 一场精彩的球

## Corpus
CCD corpus (ChineseClassifierDataset)
- based oon three openly available POS tagged Chinese corpora:
  - The Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese (McEnery and Xiao, 2004)
  - the UCLA Corpus of Written Chinese (Tao and Xiao, 2012)
  - the Leiden Weibo Corpus (van Esch, 2012)
