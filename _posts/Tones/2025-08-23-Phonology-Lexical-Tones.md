## Current progress
- A quick update on the inductive bias in lexical tone project. I reviewed all publicly available corpora, and only the Tong corpus explicitly annotates lexical tone production errors. I’m now testing alternative aligners to see if I can automatically extract potential tone errors from the other corpora. So far, I’ve identified 175 disyllabic tone errors across two corpora.
