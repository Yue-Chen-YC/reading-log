## Week 1

Every week, present a paper
- 20 minutes worth of presentation materia,l and with some questions for at least 10 minutes of discussion

Submit a brief summary on one of the papers before class on Frida,y 1/16.
- Bright space for submission and upload it there. 
    - Do not write the paper that is presented today 
- 1 - 3 paragraphs of all readings if not presenting 
    - If presenting, then focus on the paper you are presenting 
- Spreadsheet will be set up later today
    - One summary per week on Thursday evening and Sunday night for the next week's readings 

Programming exercise: will set up the code, we will need to fill in things, and get familiar with it.

Final project
- Students will form groups of 2-4 members and complete a research project

Attendance is required, 10%

Cognitive neuropsychology of language approach 
- The organization of language and the brain (language disorder after brain damage)
    - Making interference about the cognitive architecture of the intact language processing system from studying the different ways in which spoken or written language abilities broke down after brain damage
- Case 1 1861 
    - Patient presents with an inability to speak fluently, utterances contain no grammatical structures, and singing is still intact
    - What can you infer from this patient’s behavior?
    - Lesion in the left inferior frontal cortex in the vicinity of motor-articulatory areas and just superior to the lateral sulcus (sylvan fissure)
        - Impaired speech but comprehension and other mental faculties were intact; autopsy revealed lesion in left frontal cortex
            - Broca’s aphasia 
            - Scanned the brain and found that left hemisphere is half less than right hemisphere 
- case 2: wenicke’s aphasia —> first one made a theory of what’s going on
    - Lesion in the left posterior cortex in the auditory and speech perception 
        - Localized damage to different brain areas are affecting different communication functions 
- There is a highway of neurons connecting two language areas 
    - Different roles in different brain areas 

Aphasia 
- Fluent aphasia vs. non-fluent aphasia 
- Expressive aphasia = broca’s aphasia 
- Receptive aphasia = wenicke’s aphasia, speak in fluent sentences but it has no meaning, poor speech and reading comprehension 
- Conduction aphasia = mostly be able to comprehend and communication but if u do repetition task, they can not repeat or listing 
- Anomic aphasia = lose words, lose particular 
- Global aphasia = can not communicate 
- ppa = accurate or stroke, an aphasia worse during the time as dementia or Alzheimer’s 

Two things going on
- Left visual cortex is damaged prevent visual signals 
- Disconnection of cortex that connects two hemisphere 
    - Laxisia, everything is intact except for the reading ability 
- Right visual cortex will get enough information 
- Preventing the right to comprehansion
- Left field is not doing enough for language 

Damage to the corpus callous 
- Presents right-hemisphere areas from communicating with left-hemisphere language areas 


Lesion-symptom mapping
- Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping 
    - The more red it is the stronger effect of having lesions here

Broca and wernicke are dead 
- Why are we still talking about this, cus it’s outdated 
- Survey of all papers in the past 200 years 
- And ask them what do u think where’s the wernicke’s area 

Brodman’s cytoarchitectonic map 
- The things you try to infer about which brain damage 
- It’s more complicated now
