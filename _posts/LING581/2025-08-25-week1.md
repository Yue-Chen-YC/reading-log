## Readings

## A Guide to Analysis in MaxEnt Optimality Theory Chapters 1 and 2

## My thoughts 
- For some data that is quantitative (“定量的”“数量化的”。也就是说，这些语言学数据是以数量、频率、百分比、统计指标等形式呈现或需要用数值方法来分析的), which means there might not be a rigorous analysis for this type of data, but MaxEnt grammar is suitable for this purpose

## My Questions
- Why are probabilities suitable for gradient phenomena?
- MaxEnt 为什么可以 Provide concrete interpretations for linguistic experiments？
- MaxEnt offers both quantitatively precise analysis as well as statistical testing, which permits each constraint in the analysis to be checked for whether it is making a meaningful contribution
  - 突然感觉！MaxEnt 是不是可以用来test syntactic binding constraint for reflexive？如果我已经有英语和中文的proportion data的话 （chapter 8 有syntax example）

  
## Chapter 1: Purpose and orientation
- MaxEnt Grammars are a formal apparatus for constraint-based linguistics, and an outgrowth of OT, which works on probabilities (suitable for gradient phenomena)
  - free variation = multiple outputs from a single input
  - gradient well-formedness (syntactic judgments or phonotactics
  - Matchup of native speaker judgments
    - to statistical patterns in their languages
  - Provide concrete interpretations for linguistic experiments

## 1.2 MaxEnt as tool vs. theory
2 prespectives
  1. practical = need an analytical tool to help scholars to deal with quantitative linguistic data
  2. theory = MaxEnt can extract from the theory's basic principles through reasoning and testing against language-particular phenomena and typology

## 1.3 Why is it called “MaxEnt”?
- Maximum Entropy “最大熵”在语言学中指的是 Goldwater 和 Johnson 在 2003  提出的OT中附加的数学工具，旨在使其具有概率性
- The OT architecture coupled with the MaxEnt math

## Chapter 2: The analysis of variation in outputs
