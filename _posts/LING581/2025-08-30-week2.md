## Readings： French schwa and gradient cumulativity

## My thoughts 

## My Questions
1. What's a singleton?
2. Sublinear, linear and superlinear 这个是什么意思？

## Summary
- Explore the interaction of two phonological factors that condition schwa-zero alternations in French
  1. **Schwa is more likely after two consonants than a singleton**
    - What's a singleton?
    - from online: a consonant that is not geminated; it's a single consonant sound, as opposed to a geminate, which is a long consonant. The primary difference is typically duration, with geminates being significantly longer than their singleton counterparts
  2. **schwa is more likely between stressed syllables than elsewhere**
- **Method**: new data from judgment study
  - **Finding**:
    - Both factors play a role in schwa epenthesis (insert a schwa) and deletion (delete a schwa)
    - Both factors interact cumulatively
      - strong effect together than individually
    - Cumulatively, interaction is better modeled with weighted than with ranked constraints
  - Stochastic OT can model cumulative interactions, but only sublinear ones
    - **Downside**: the effect of a constraint is weaker in the cumulative context than on its own
  - Weighted constraint models (MaxEnt and Noisy HG)
  - Can model the full range of cumulativity
    - Sublinear, linear, and superlinear
    - 这个是什么意思？
- Stochastic OT is hampered by the fact that the data displays superlinear cuulativity
- Noisy HG and MaxEnt fare better on this dataset = MaxEnt has the best fit

## Aim of this paper 
- focus on the interaction of two phonological factors that affect the probability of schwa deletion and epenthesis
  1. whether a singleton consonant or a consonant culture precedes the schwa
     - Deletion is less likely, and epenthesis more likely, when schwa is preceded by a cluster
     - Schwa deletion only applies when a single consonant precedes
       - Dell's rule abstracts away from the fact that schwa deletion can also apply when a cluster precedes
       - Deletion almost certainly applies in these examples with a lower probability
     - Schwa epenthesis only applies after a morpheme that ends in a cluster


## Introduction
- Dell (1985) found in Parisian French that both deletion of underlying schwa and epenthesis are involved in producing the surface distribution
  - Schwa deletion and epenthesis
    - /dœvrɛ/ → [dvrɛ] Tu devrais partir. ‘You should go.’ (Schwa deletion)
      - œ -> 0 between consonants, produced with a surface schwa
    - /mœe/ → [m] Tu me dois de l’argent. ‘You owe me money.’ (Schwa deletion)
      - œ -> 0 between nasal and vowel, produced with a surface schwa
    - /film/ → [filmœ] un film danois ‘a Danish film’ (Schwa epenthesis)
      - 0 -> œ after nasal at word final position, produced without a surface schwa
  - In some words, schwa never alternates with zero, even in a phonological environment where deletion is usually likely
  - both variations are possible in a neutral rate and register
