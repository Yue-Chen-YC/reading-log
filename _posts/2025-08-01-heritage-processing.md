## My thoughts

## Summary 

This study investigated how heritage Spanish-English bilinguals integrate their cue hierarchies to process simple sentences in both Spanish and English. 
Previous research on heritage Spanish-English bilinguals and late bilinguals has demonstrated differences in cue utlization and sentence interpretation compared to monolinguals, but still show good-enough processing (e.g., when the first-noun agent heuristic, a semantic representation of the sentence will be processed instead of a syntactic one).

##  Key Concepts
The unified competition model
- Bilinguals show a variety of patterns in sentence interpretation strategies depending on language proficiency 

## Research Aim

## Method
- Participants
  - 32 Spanish-English heritage speakers
 
- Materials 
  - 80 inanimate sentences in English and Spanish with subject-verb-object and object-verb-subject word orders.
  - proficiency and dominance

## Analyses


## Results
- For Spanish sentences, participants read the OVS word order faster
- English proficiency was a significant predictor for sentence reading time and choice selection time but did not predict word choice
- Inanimate-Inanimate sentence pose challenges for cue utilization and themantic role assignment due to semantic limitation
- prioritize semantic plausibility over syntactic represeantions in sentence processing and suggest a good-enough processing model
